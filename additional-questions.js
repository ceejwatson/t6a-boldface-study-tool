    question: "What is the maximum starter limit time?",
    options: ["10 seconds", "20 seconds", "30 seconds", "60 seconds"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Maximum torque starter limit is 20 seconds. Exceeding this can overheat and damage the starter motor. After each start/motoring attempt, wait 30 seconds before the next attempt, then 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 30 minutes. These cooling periods prevent starter burnout.",
    limitation: true,

    options: ["750°C", "820°C", "870°C", "871°C"],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "Do not attempt restart if ITT exceeds 871°C. This temperature indicates severe engine damage from a hot start. Attempting to restart could cause catastrophic turbine failure. At 871-1000°C, you have only 5 seconds before permanent damage occurs.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-24",
    category: "Propulsion",
    topic: "Engine",
    difficulty: "medium",
    question: "What is the transient ITT limit and duration?",
    options: ["821-870°C for 10 seconds", "821-870°C for 20 seconds", "871-1000°C for 5 seconds", "750-820°C for 30 seconds"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Transient ITT limit is 821-870°C for 20 seconds. This allows brief temperature excursions during rapid power changes or hot day operations. Continuous operation at these temperatures will damage turbine blades.",

    difficulty: "medium",
    question: "What is the maximum crosswind for formation takeoff/landing?",
    options: ["10 knots", "15 knots", "20 knots", "25 knots"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Maximum crosswind for formation takeoff/landing is 15 knots. Formation operations require tighter limits because you must maintain position while compensating for crosswind. The standard crosswind limit (25 knots dry) is reduced to 15 knots for formation work.",
    limitation: true,
  },

    id: "mc-30",
    category: "Wind Limits",
    topic: "Limitations",
    difficulty: "medium",
    question: "What is the maximum tailwind component for takeoff?",
    options: ["5 knots", "10 knots", "15 knots", "20 knots"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Maximum tailwind for takeoff is 10 knots. Tailwinds increase takeoff distance and reduce climb performance. While landing with a tailwind is sometimes necessary, takeoff should be delayed or use another runway if tailwind exceeds 10 knots.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-31",
    category: "Canopy",
    topic: "Limitations",

    question: "What is the maximum altitude for intentional spins?",
    options: ["18,000 feet PA", "20,000 feet PA", "22,000 feet PA", "25,000 feet PA"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Spins above 22,000 feet pressure altitude are prohibited. At higher altitudes, reduced air density makes spin recovery more difficult and unpredictable. Additionally, OBOGS performance degrades and hypoxia risk increases during the high workload of spin recovery.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-33",
    category: "Spins",
    topic: "Limitations",
    difficulty: "critical",
    question: "What is the minimum altitude for intentional spins?",
    options: ["5,000 feet PA", "8,000 feet PA", "10,000 feet PA", "13,500 feet PA"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Spins below 10,000 feet pressure altitude are prohibited. This ensures adequate altitude for spin recovery (which can take 3,000-5,000 feet) plus margin for errors or delayed recognition. Combined with the entry altitude of 13,500 feet MSL, this provides safety buffer.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-34",
    category: "Spins",
    topic: "Limitations",
    difficulty: "critical",
    question: "What is the minimum cloud clearance for intentional spin entry?",
    options: ["1,000 feet", "3,000 feet", "5,000 feet", "7,000 feet"],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "Minimum cloud clearance for spins is 7,000 feet above clouds. This massive buffer ensures you remain VMC during the entire spin and recovery. Flying into clouds during a spin makes recovery nearly impossible due to spatial disorientation.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-35",
    category: "Ice",
    topic: "Limitations",
    difficulty: "high",
    question: "What is the maximum icing band (thickness of icing layer)?",
    options: ["1,000 feet", "3,000 feet", "5,000 feet", "10,000 feet"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Maximum icing band is 5,000 feet and must be light rime only. Even though the T-6A is not certified for flight into known icing, this parameter defines inadvertent icing encounter limits. If you encounter icing thicker than 5,000 feet or any clear ice, immediately execute emergency descent/climb to exit icing conditions.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-36",
    category: "Temperature",
    topic: "Limitations",
    difficulty: "medium",
    question: "What is the minimum ambient temperature for ground operations?",
    options: ["-40°C", "-30°C", "-23°C", "-10°C"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Ground operation is limited to -23°C to +43°C ambient temperature. Below -23°C, hydraulic fluid becomes too viscous, battery performance degrades critically, and other systems may freeze or malfunction. Above +43°C (remember max takeoff is +51°C), ground operations risk overheating.",
    limitation: true,

  {
    id: "mc-37",
    category: "Propulsion",
    topic: "Engine",
    difficulty: "high",
    question: "What is the maximum oil pressure limit?",
    options: ["120 PSI", "150 PSI", "180 PSI", "200 PSI"],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "Maximum oil pressure is 200 PSI. Excessive oil pressure indicates blockage in the oil system or relief valve failure. This can cause seal failure and oil leaks. Normal takeoff/max oil pressure is 90-120 PSI.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-38",
    category: "Propulsion",

    question: "What is the minimum oil temperature?",
    options: ["-50°C", "-40°C", "-30°C", "-20°C"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Minimum oil temperature is -40°C. Below this temperature, oil viscosity is too high for proper lubrication, risking engine damage on start. In extreme cold, external engine preheat may be required before starting.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-39",
    category: "Propulsion",

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Transient oil temperature limit is 106-110°C for 10 minutes. Normal max is 10-105°C. Brief temperature excursions above 105°C are acceptable during climbs on hot days, but sustained high oil temperature indicates cooling system problems.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-40",
    category: "Propulsion",
    topic: "Engine",
    difficulty: "high",
    question: "What is the maximum fuel flow for all phases of flight?",
    options: ["699 PPH", "750 PPH", "799 PPH", "850 PPH"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "Maximum fuel flow is 799 PPH (pounds per hour) for all phases of flight. Fuel flow above this indicates a fuel control unit malfunction and risks engine overspeed or overtemp. Normal max power fuel flow is significantly less than this limit.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-41",
    category: "Propulsion",
    topic: "Engine",

    question: "What is the aerobatics/spins oil pressure range at idle?",
    options: ["10-20 PSI", "15-40 PSI for 5 seconds", "40-60 PSI", "60-90 PSI"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Aerobatics/spins idle oil pressure is 15-40 PSI for 5 seconds. During negative G or unusual attitudes, oil unporting can temporarily drop pressure. This 5-second allowance prevents nuisance warnings during aerobatics while still protecting the engine.",
    limitation: true,
  },
  {
    id: "mc-42",
    category: "Propulsion",
    topic: "Engine",

    question: "What is the normal aerobatics/spins oil pressure range?",
    options: ["40-80 PSI", "40-130 PSI", "90-120 PSI", "90-150 PSI"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Aerobatics/spins oil pressure is 40-130 PSI (wider than normal 90-120 PSI). During aerobatic maneuvers, oil sloshes around causing pressure fluctuations. The wider range accounts for these variations while maintaining adequate lubrication.",

    ],
    explanation: "ITT (Interstage Turbine Temperature) limits by condition: Idle Max = 750°C (normal ground operations), Takeoff/Max = 820°C (maximum continuous ITT for all flight phases), Transient = 821-870°C for 20 seconds (brief excursions during power changes), Do Not Restart Above = 871°C (indicates severe hot start damage). ITT directly correlates to turbine blade temperature and life - exceeding limits causes immediate, permanent damage.",

    explanation: "Oil pressure ranges: Takeoff/Max = 90-120 PSI (normal operations), Aerobatics/Spins = 40-130 PSI (wider range for unusual attitudes), Aero/Spins Idle = 15-40 PSI for 5 seconds (allows oil unporting during negative G), Maximum = 200 PSI (indicates blockage or relief valve failure). Oil pressure ensures adequate lubrication - too low risks bearing failure, too high risks seal failure.",

    explanation: "Fuel states and quantities: Normal Recovery = 200 lbs (normal pattern fuel), Minimum Fuel Dual = 150 lbs (ATC priority, 2 crew), Minimum Fuel Solo = 200 lbs (ATC priority, 1 crew - higher due to less efficient CG), Emergency Fuel = 100 lbs (immediate landing required).

Understanding these parameters helps you monitor engine health and avoid damaging resonance.",
