## Question Format

Each question includes:
- **Unique ID**: ap-mc-001 through ap-mc-062
- **Category**: Lesson/topic area
- **Topic**: Specific subject matter
- **Difficulty**: medium, high, or critical
- **Question**: Scenario-based or knowledge-based question
- **Options**: 4 answer choices (1 correct, 3 plausible distractors)
- **Correct Answer**: Index (0-3) of correct option
- **Explanation**: Detailed explanation with context
- **Limitation**: Boolean flag (all false - no limitations)
- **Objective Type**: Learning action verb (recall, identify, memorize, etc.)
- **Learning Objective**: Original objective from Student Guide

## Question Design Principles

1. **Scenario-Based**: Many questions present realistic flight scenarios requiring application of knowledge
2. **Safety-Critical Focus**: Emphasis on immediately life-threatening conditions and emergency procedures
3. **Practical Application**: Questions test ability to apply concepts, not just memorize facts
4. **Realistic Distractors**: Wrong answers are plausible and based on common misconceptions
5. **Detailed Explanations**: Each explanation provides context, rationale, and additional learning points

## Usage Recommendations

### For Students:
- Use these questions to test comprehension after reading each lesson
- Review explanations thoroughly, even for correct answers
- Focus extra attention on "critical" difficulty questions
- Practice BOLDFACE procedures until memorized

### For Instructors:
- Use as formative assessment during instruction
- Incorporate into review sessions before chamber flights
- Use explanations to reinforce key learning points
- Emphasize scenario-based application during debriefs

### For Test Development:
- Questions align with "Samples of Behavior" learning objectives
- Can be used as-is or modified for formal assessments
- Difficulty levels help balance exam difficulty
- All questions support measurable learning outcomes

## Critical Safety Items Emphasized

The following life-critical procedures are tested:
1. Hypoxia treatment procedures (gangload regulator)
2. Treatment of all physiological symptoms (same procedure)
3. Time of Useful Consciousness awareness
4. AGSM performance
5. Spatial disorientation recognition and recovery
6. Decompression recognition and response
7. Oxygen equipment preflight (RICE check)
8. Alcohol consumption policy
9. Laser exposure procedures
10. Trapped gas disorder prevention (Valsalva)

## Learning Objective Alignment

Questions are mapped to specific learning objectives using action verbs:
- **Recall**: Remember specific facts (e.g., definitions, policies)
- **Identify**: Recognize concepts in context (e.g., symptoms, causes)
- **Recognize**: Distinguish between similar concepts
- **Memorize**: Commit critical procedures to memory (BOLDFACE)
- **List**: Enumerate multiple items
- **Describe**: Explain processes or systems
- **Select**: Choose correct option from alternatives
- **Outline**: Provide structured overview
