Information  
Introduction to Human Factors in Av iation  
Today, as never before, you face the challenge of expanding technology and a rapidly changing world. The ever 
increasing complexity of weapon systems and mission requirements place greater and more diverse stress on 
crewmembers . The Aerospace Phy siology (A P) course prepares you to successfully cope with these stresses, whether 
they are the physical requirements of egress, physiological stresses of loss of aircraft pressurization, or performance 
decrements caused by self -imposed stress. We have reache d a point where the major limiting factors to weapon system 
performance are the human limitations of the crewmember. These human limitations form the basis of a field of study, 
Human Factors , which is a part of this course.  
The Human Factor  
According to th e Civil Aviation Authority (as cited by the AFRL Handbook of Aerospace and Operational Physiology, 
2016), “Human Factors is concerned to optimize the relationship between people and their activities, by the systematic 
application of human sciences, integrated within the framework of systems engineering.”  The role of human factors in 
aviation has its roots in  the earliest days of aviation, where a ircraft began rapidly exceeding the human’s capability of 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 2 
directly sensing & responding to the vehicle and the en vironment, and their ability to ensure optimum outcome & safety 
of flight (Wise et al., 2009).  
The Royal Flying Corps (UK) was the first to harness human factor specialists in the form of flight surgeons during the 
First World War.  The aeromedical factors identified during the early investigations have become foundational to the 
USAF’s aim to prevent aviation mishaps and preserve combat assets.  
In modern aviation, human factors have historically accounted for the majority (60 -80 percent) of aircraft acciden ts. As 
a result, the USAF continues to develop and improve programs to eliminate human factors errors.  
SHELL Model  
According to Heinrich (1980), “the inseparable tie between individuals, their tools and machines, and their general work environment” is critical to understanding human systems integration (HSI). One of the most well -known HSI models is 
the SHELL Model  (Figure 1 -1). The SHELL model is a conceptual model of human factors that clarifies the scope of 
aviation human factors and assists in understan ding the relationships between the aviation system (and flying subsystems) 
and the human component in the aviation system (and human subsystems).  
The original model was actually the S -H-E-L model (with one L ) and was fi rst developed by Elwyn Edwards 1972 . 
Edwards’ model describes the four basic components needed for successful man- machine integration. SHEL is an 
acronym used to represent the four components of the model and is based on a systems perspective that the human is rarely, if ever, the sole cause of an accident (Wiegmann & Shapell, 2003).  
The S represents Software  which encompasses more than computer software that drives the logic and design of a system, 
but software also comprises the rules, regulations, policies, and guidance that govern how a sy stem operates. The H  
represents the Hardware  associated with a given system such as equipment, material, and other physical assets. The E  
refers to the Environment  that humans operate in such as the cockpit, flightdeck, ground control station (GCS), the 
organization, and the culture in which the human (represented by L) operates. The L  symbolizes the Liveware  (human 
element) in the aviation system and considers human performance, human capabilities, and their limitations. Edwards’ 
SHEL model has all but dis appeared in modern HF theory; however; it is survived by its offspring, the SHELL model.  
According to the website Skybrary, in 1975, Frank Hawkins  modified Edwards’ SHEL concept into a building block  
structure, along with an additional Liveware element as represented by a second L. The  additional (outer) L  represents 
the critical Liveware -Liveware interface between the primary human element (the inner L) and the secondary human 
element (the outer L ). Examples of secondary human elements are other crew members, air traffic controllers, 
maintainers, meteorologists, commanders, etc.  
All five SHELL components play an important role in human performance however, effective component interaction is 
critical to optimizing human performance. At some point, human oper ators will recognize, either consciously or 
subconsciously, when there is a barrier to effective component interaction. Below is a two SHELL -component interaction 
example:  
An automobile driver reaches down to turn the radio station, and realizes the knob i s missing. It is obvious the radio 
knob is missing because it is absent when the driver reaches down to change the station. This is an example of an 
interaction barrier in a two -dimensional Liveware (driver) -Hardware (radio knob) relationship. Therefore, t he 
solution to this barrier is to find and replace the radio knob.  
In the midst of all of today’s technological changes, there are two factors that have undergone little change  — (1) the 
atmosphere in which we conduct aerospace operations, and (2) the phys iologic requirements unique to our human nature. 
Each time you fly, you enter an environment where changes in ambient pressure (the immediate surrounding atmospheric 
pressure), weather,  and temperature can pose significant hazards. Therefore, it’s imperati ve for you to know the 
characteristics of the atmosphere. This knowledge will form a basis to understand the physiological limits to functioning 
in this dynamic environment.

The Atmosphere  
For simplicity, the atmosphere is define d as the gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. According to Central 
Connecticut State University, the earth’s atmosphere is a reservoir of gases and air is a mixture of gases  that is naturally 
odorless, colorless, tas teless and formless. T he atmosphere i s bound to the Earth by gravity and provides some unique 
protective functions that help sustain our existence on Earth.  
The a tmosphere contains oxygen which is essential for life, as you already know.  In return humans and animals produce 
carbon dioxide, wh ich is essential for plant life.  Plants in turn produce oxygen for us to use.  It also provides a shield that 
absorbs harmful electromagnetic radiation, streams of charged particles in the solar wind, and from natural and human 
made space debris.  Lastly, th e atmosphere contains precipitation, helping to maintain the temperature and climate.  
Atmospheric Characteristics  
The composition of the atmosphere is remarkably constant up to approximately 300,000 feet.  The gaseous envelope 
surrounding the Earth is divid ed into layers.  Sphere  signifies the actual layer of air, whereas pause  is the outer boundary 
of that layer that separates the next layer.  A physicist or meteorologist would divide the atmo sphere as depicted in Figure 
1-2. The densest layer of the atmosphere is the one closest to the earth, the troposphere. Almost all flying takes place in 
the troposphere. The t roposphere is the layer  from the Earth’s surface to approximately 30,000 feet at the north and south 
poles and about 60,000 feet at the equator.  The difference of 30,000 feet is due to the heated air at the equator, because 
warm/hot air expands. This is the layer that captures the most solar energy.  In this layer there is water vapor (humidity), 
a decrease in temperature with the increase of altitude,  and weather phenomena  (Reinhart, 2008).  The Tropopause is the  
layer of temperature stability . Stratosphere is a layer that has little change in temperature and has little water vapor. There 
is a layer that can extend to a height of 55  miles, this is somet imes called the mesosphere. Ionosphere is where the ozone 
is most prevalent.  This layer protections the earth from ultraviolet radiation.  Exosphere is the outer boundary of the 
atmosphere, sometimes referred to as deep space.  
These layers are composed of n itrogen, oxygen and argon with traces of carbon dioxide and other inert gases (such as 
helium and neon). The approximate percentages of gases in the atmosphere are 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen 
and 1 percent other gases (including 0.03 percent carbon dioxide). These percentages remain relatively constant with 
increased altitude. So what changes? Pressure ! 
 
Figure 1 -2 — Physical Divisions of the Atmosphere  
Pressure  
Pressure is defined as force that acts on a unit area. Atmospheric or barometric pressure is the combined weight of all the atmospheric gases acting to create a force upon the surface of the Earth. This force is caused by gravity pulling gas 
molecules earthward, as well as thermal and solar radiation expanding the gases outward toward space.  A barometer is a 
tool used in measuring atmospheric pressure  (Figure 1 -3). Density and pressure decrease exponentially as one ascends 
from the earth’s surface.  Pressure can be measured at any altitude. The weight of the atmosphere can be measured in 
pounds per square inch ( psi), millimeters of mercury (mmHg), or inches of mercury (inHg). Atmospheric pressure 
readings will vary daily, depending on changing surface temperatures, humidity, high and low pressure weather fronts.

Figure 1 -3 — Measuring Pr essure  
Pressure altimeters (Figure 1 -4) sense  atmospheric pressure and convert the data into feet above mean sea level. To 
construct an instrument of this nature, a standard pressure reading for each altitude had to be developed. This standard 
which is ref erred to as U.S. Standard Atmosphere was computed by taking the average pressure and temperature readings 
for a year at mid -latitude locations. At sea level, these readings were determined to be +15 °C and 760 mmHg (29.92 
inHg) pressure.  
 
Figure 1 -4 — Pressure Altimeters  
Figure 1 -5 shows the U.S. Standard Atmosphere pressures at various altitudes. The pressure at 18,000 feet is 379.4 
mmHg, or about one half of the pressure encountered at sea level. This illustrates that the greatest pressure change occurs 
at lower atmospheric levels between sea level and 18,000 feet.

Temperature  
The earth’s surface temperatures vary day to day and season to season. Altitudes up to about 35,000 feet reflect a constant 
decrease in temperature of about 2 °C (3.6 °F) per 1,000  feet (Figure 1 -6). This const ant decrease is referred to as the 
standard temperature lapse rate. If it is 30°C on the runway at sea level, then the temperature would be about - 10 °C at 
20,000 feet. By using the standard temperature lapse rate you can determine that there is a 40 degree Celsius change in temperature ( -2 °C/1,000 feet) . 
 
Figure 1 -6 — Temperature Lapse Rate 
Divisions of the Atmosphere  
Physiological Zone  
The physiological zone extends from sea level to approximately 10,000 feet and is the zone the human body is adapted to. Life above this zone requires considerable acclimatization. During ascent in the physiological zone, atmospheric 
pressure drops from 760 mmHg to 523 mmHg. Even though the oxygen partial pressure (PO
2) falls, the body’s 
compensatory mechanisms keep oxygen delivery within normal limits. Only at the upper boundary of the physiological 
zone and in tissues with very high O 2 requirements, e.g., the retina, are symptoms of O 2 deficiency noted. When flying 
unpressurized above 10,000 feet mean sea level ( MSL ), the use of supplemental oxygen is required.  
Physiological Deficient Zone  
The Physiological Deficient zone is significant because the reduced atmospheric pressure means there is an inadequate amount of oxygen pressure to sustain normal physiologic functions . This zone extends from approximately 10,000 feet 
to approximat ely 50,000 feet. Decompression sickness (caused by evolved gas) can also occur in the body tissues and 
joints at in this zone. This phenomena will be covered in later chapters. Atmospheric pressure decreases from 523 mmHg at 10,000 feet to 87 mmHg at 50,00 0 feet. Pressure suits are required above FL500.  
Space Equivalent Zone  
The space equivalent zone exists above 50,000 feet. The physiological problems of flight above 50,000 feet are essentially 
the same as those for space. The need for protection in a seal ed cabin or pressure suit, the problem of ebullism (tissue 
water vaporization) above 63,000 feet, and other adverse influences on the body make this area of the atmosphere 
extremely hazardous (Figure 1 -7).

Gas Laws 
Most of the physiological complications can be explained by several elementary principles of gas behavior as individuals 
ascen d and descend  within the earth’s atmosphere. These gas laws are th e basis for much of the information in future 
lessons. To understand the gas laws you should have an understanding of Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure.  
Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure  
Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure states the total pressure of a mixture  of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures 
of each gas in the mixture or stated slightly differently; the amount of pressure that a single gas out of a mixture of gases  
contributes to the sum or total pressure of that mixture.  The denotation fo r the partial pressure of Nitrogen, Oxygen, and 
Carbon Dioxide is PN 2, PO 2, PCO 2, respectively. The pressure exerted by each gas in a mixture is independent of other 
gases in the mixture. For example, the total pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 76 0 mmHg this pressure equals PN 2 
(592.8) + PO 2 (160) + PCO 2 (.30) and the partial pressure of other trace gases (6.9).  
Dalton’s Law explains how exposure to a high ambient altitude can reduce the available oxygen (Figure 1 -8). As ambient 
altitude increases,  the total atmospheric pressure decreases causing, specifically partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) to 
decrease even though the percentage of oxygen remains the same. For example, at sea level the PO 2 is 21 percent of 760 
mmHg or 160 mmHg. At 18,000 feet, PO 2 is 21 percent of 380 mmHg or 80 mmHg.  
 
Figure 1 -8 — Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure  
Boyle’s Law  
Boyle’s Law states when the temperature 
remains constant, as in the human body, a volume 
of gas is inversely proportional to the pressure surrounding it. This principle explains why a balloon expan ds as it ascends and also why a 
volume of air expands when trapped in a body 
cavity when the pressure is reduced around it. 
Boyle’s Law explains for the effects of pressure changes in the ears, sinuses, teeth,  and 
gastrointestinal tract.  
Henry’s Law  
Henry’ s Law is when the amount of gas in a 
solution varies directly with the partial pressure of that gas over the solution. Therefore, if pressure is reduced above the solution, some gas will come out of solution. This principle explains why carbon dioxide bubbles are released when a carbonated beverage container is opened or why nitrogen bubbles may come out of solution in body tissues during ascent. The nitrogen bubbles can lead to altitude -induced decompression 
sickness.  
 
 
Figure 1 -9 — Boyle’s Law

UNCLASSIFIED 7 
Ideal Gas Law  
The ideal gas law is a common model for relating the 
properties of dry air . This law describes gas behavior 
using three interrelated variables:  pressu re (P), volume 
(V), and  temperature (T).  The ideal gas law can be 
used, for example,  to illustrate how temperature is 
proportion al to pressure in an oxygen cylinder  or how 
pressure is in versely proportional to volume when 
volume is not fixed . 
Gaseous Diffusion  
Gaseous diffusion is fundamental to the physiologic 
processes of lung and cellular respiration. It further 
applies to the process of denitrogenation, the removal of nitrogen from the bo dy by breathing 100% oxygen, 
(HAOP, 2016).  A gas will diffuse from an area of higher 
concentration or pressure to an area of lower concentration or pressure until equilibrium is reached. 
The sp eed of this movement depends on the relative 
concentrations of the gases (strength of the diffusion 
gradient). The physiological significance of this law 
relates to transfer of gases between the blood or other body fluids and the tissues they contact. For example, 
the gas transfer that takes place in the lungs by oxygen 
moving out of the lungs to the bloodstream and carbon 
dioxide moving from the bloodstream into the lungs based on the movement of the gases from a higher concentration or 
pressure area to a lower area until it has reached equilibrium.  This along with Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressure explains 
hypoxic hypoxia.   
Summary  
The overall go al of Aerospace Physiology is to train crewmembers to increase safety and mission effectiveness through 
the ident ification and elimination of physical, physiological, and psychological limitations of the flying environment. We 
began by examining the physical environment in which aircraft operate, the atmosphere, and how those gasses behave 
according to various gas la ws. As altitude increases the ambient pressure decreases but the relative makeup of the gasses 
in the atmosphere remains the same. Human adaptation to these changes led to the definition of three physiological zones 
within the atmosphere  — the physiologica l zone, the physiological deficient zone, and the space equivalent zone. Finally, 
in order to understand some of the physiological changes that occur with changes in altitude, we must first understand 
their cause. Most of these physiological changes are ca used by elementary principles of gas behavior, the gas laws. Now 
that we have a better understanding of the aerospace environment, we can examine how our body is affected by this 
environment as we travel through it.

Introduction 
The respiratory and circulatory systems work together to supply the body with oxygen and rid the body of car bon dioxide.  
Respiration is the process our body uses to exchange gases with our environment. The primary purpose of respiration is 
to provide oxygen to the body and remove excess carbon dioxide from the body. The respiratory process also helps 
maintain the acid -base balance (pH) of the blood.  
Respiration involves ventilation of the lungs, oxygen diffusion from the lungs to the blood, circulation of the blood throughout the body delivering oxygen to body cells, and the diffusion of oxygen from the blood int o each individual 
cell. Oxygen is then used in cellular respiration (metabolism). Metabolism is defined as the sum of all the physical and chemical processes used by cells to produce energy and building materials needed to sustain life. As we move forward 
we will discuss the Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory and Circulatory Systems.  
Information  
Functions of the Respiratory System  
Respiration is the process our body uses to exchange gases with our environment.  The functions of respiration are : 
Intake , filtering, and conditioning of air (warm and humidify)  
Gas exchange  
Temperature regulation  
Metabolic function  
Maintain acid -base balance (pH) of blood  
Respiratory Anatomy 
As the air is inhaled it will travel through mouth, nose, travels through pharynx, to trachea, and then the lungs  
(Figure 2 -1). The Oral -Nasal Cavities (mouth, nose, and pharynx) are lined with a mucous membrane as well as, there 
are hair like structures (called cilia) in the nasal cavity mucous membrane filter inspired air.  The oral cavity plays a lesser 
role in filtering the air, but regardless of the pathway, air is humidified and heated to body temperature before entering 
the lungs.  Humidifying and warming the air protects the lungs from being cooled or dried out.  Inhaling through the 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 12 
mouth, especially in cold, dry climates, does not allow air to be 
sufficiently warmed or humidified.  Therefore, long term exposure 
of the lower lung to cool dry air can lead to infection; which can lead to a cold, or other illnesses.  
Next the air travel s through the t rachea (or windpipe), which 
divides into two branches, one to the right side and one to the left side of the lung.  These branches (bronchi)  form part of the root 
structures of the lungs’ air passages. Then the air reaches the 
Lungs.  The lung s occupy the greatest part of the chest or thoracic 
cavity and connect to the bronchi.  The lungs’ prime function is to 
allow oxygen to move from the air to the microscopic blood 
vessels (capillaries) and carbon dioxide to move from the 
capillaries into the  lungs. The bronchi of each lung subdivide 
becoming narrower, shorter and more numerous as they penetrate 
deeper into the lung. The bronchi branch until they becom e 
bronchioles. The bronchioles continue to branch until they become 
the alveolar ducts, leadi ng to the alveoli.  
Alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs at the end of the bronchioles.  Their walls have an excellent blood supply provided 
by capillaries. In the lung, gas exchange between the respiratory and circulatory systems occurs at the alveolar -capillary 
interface. Oxygen and carbon dioxide move between air and blood by simple diffusion, (Law of Gaseous Diffusion) from an area of high to low partial pressure.  
Respiration Control and Integrated Responses  
The rate and depth of breathing are modified in response to changes in the concentrations of carbon dioxide ( CO
2), 
oxygen ( O2), and hydrogen ions ( H+) in arterial blood. Chemoreceptors in the medulla, the central chemoreceptors, and 
in the aortic arch and carotid bodies at the bifurcation of the comm on carotid arteries, the peripheral chemoreceptors, 
send both excitatory and inhibitory signals to the medulla, adjusting ventilation to the changing demands of the body.  
There are three ways that the body regulates the arterial blood pH.  The f irst line of  defense is the chemical acid -base 
buffer system of the body fluids, which reacts within seconds.  The respiratory system is the second line of defense, which 
regulates the removal of CO 2. The respiratory system takes a few minutes to activate if the acid -base buffer does not 
regulate the imbalance.  Lastly , the kidneys regulate the amount of H+ leaving the body.  The kidneys are the slowest but 
most powerful of the regulatory systems.  They can take hours and up to weeks to resolve the imbalance.  
The most obvi ous and important for you as aircrew is the respiratory system.  Therefore, it’s useful to consider the overall 
response of the system to changes in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( PaCO 2), arterial partial pressure of 
oxygen ( PaO2), and pH.  
The most important factor in the control of ventilation under normal conditions is the P aCO 2 of the arterial blood. The 
sensitivity of this control is remarkable. In the course of daily activity with periods of rest and exercise, the arterial P aCO 2 
is nor mally held to within 3 mmHg of 45 mmHg. A reduction in arterial P aCO 2 is very effective in reducing the stimulus 
for ventilation. For example, if you hyperventilate voluntarily for a few seconds, you will find that you have no urge to breathe for a short p eriod.  
Arterial P aO2 can normall y be reduced from the normal 95  mmHg to 50  – 60 mmHg without evoking a ventilatory 
response, showing that the role of this hypoxic (low oxygen) stimulus in the day by day control of ventilation is small. However, on ascent t o high altitude, a large increase in ventilation can occur in response to lack of sufficient PO
2 (your 
tidal volume and respiratory rate both increase at higher altitudes).  
This increase in ventilation can cause an increased  loss of CO 2 resulting in an inc reased  arterial blood pH. This causes a 
mild respiratory alkalosis (increase in pH) sometimes referred to as h ypocapnia . It is difficult to separate the ventilatory 
response caused by a fall in pH from that caused by an accompanying increase in P aCO 2. Howe ver, it has been shown 
that ventilation is stimulated whenever P aCO 2 is held constant and the pH is allowed to fall.  
Note  — Breathing can also be controlled by involuntary means. Involuntary control occurs when certain emotional 
stresses such as fear, anxi ety, or apprehension cause an abnormal increase in your breathing. This mechanism may take 
precedence over normal chemical control. Involuntary control can be overcome by consciously controlling your rate and depth of breathing. In this way, you can combat  the adverse effects of certain stresses on the process of ventilation.

Phases of Respiration  
Another way of looking at how respiration works is by looking at the five distinct phases  — ventilation, diffusion, 
transportation, diffusion, and utilization (Fi gures 2 -2 and 2- 3). Each phase has a specific function in the overall exchange 
of gases.  
Ventilation is the inhalation and exhalation of gas, and is mathematically defined as the volume of gas exchanged 
between the lungs and the ambient environment per uni t time.  This process is regulated to provide adequate delivery 
of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide to satisfy the demands of metabolism.  
Diffusion (1) is when the oxygen and carbon dioxide pass through the alveolar membrane and capillary w alls i nto 
the red blood cells.  
Transportation is when oxygen is carried by the blood to the cell  and tissues for utilization.  
Diffusion (2) here is the movement  of gases between the blood, the interstitial fluid, and the cells, sometimes called 
internal respiration, do wn their respective pressure gradient . 
Utilization is when the oxygen is used to produce energy which results in carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.  
  
Figure 2 -2 — Phases of Respiration  Figure 2 -3 — Ventilation Phase  
Mechanics  of Ventilation — In adults, the tidal volume (the 
amount  of gas inhaled or exhaled with each normal breath) is 
about 500 milliliters. This air is normally exchanged an average 
of 12 to 16 times per minute.  
The active component of respiration is inspiration. It is 
accomplished by the contraction (downward movement) of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles  (Figure 2 -4). This 
contraction increases the dimensions of the chest cavity, resulting 
in an overall increase in lung volume and a drop in lung pressure 
below ambient pressure.  As the pressure in the lungs decreases 
and the volume increases , the Law of Gaseous Diffusion 
demands air rushes in, filling the lungs.  
During routine exhalation, as the diaphragm relaxes, the lungs return to their original position. Lung volume decreases and internal lung pressure increases. Once again, a momentary pressure differential exists between the lungs and ambient air. However, the greater pressure now exists within the lungs, and air moves from the lungs t o the environment.  
Muscular effort is not required during exhalation. Therefore, exhalation is referred to as the passive component of 
respiration. Continuous positive pressure breathing tends to reverse the normal breathing pattern with inspiration becomi ng passive and expiration becoming active.  
Mechanics of Alveolar Diffusion — As the blood passes through the capillaries next to the alveoli the gases exchange 
through the thin layer of cellular walls. This process would continue until the partial pressure s of O
2 and CO 2 came to 
equilibrium . In the example provided (Figure 2 -5), as the blood enters the capillary the P aCO 2 is high at 45 mm Hg and 
PaO 2 is low at 40 mmHg.  The CO 2 moves into the alveoli  and the O 2 moves into the blood as the two gases approach 
equilibrium.  The alveolar partial pressure of oxygen ( PAO 2) will equal around 103 mmHg and the alveolar partial pressure 
of carbon dioxide ( PACO 2) will equal around 40 mmHg.  Although this is a  hypothetical figure, the principle of reaching 
equilibrium if diffusion were completed is shown. In the lung, equilibrium is likely not achieved due to the continuation of respiration.

Circulation  (Transportation) 
Circulation  (Transportation)  
The circulatory system (Figure 2 -6) transp orts and distributes nutrients and oxygen to the tissues and removes waste 
products of metabolism. It also shares in the regulation of body temperature, hormonal communication throughout the 
body, and the adjustment of oxygen and nutrient supplies during different physiological states. The cardiovascular system 
that accomplishes these tasks is made up of a pump (heart), a series of distributing and collecting tubes (arteries and veins), and an extensive system of thin vessels that allow the rapid exchange between the tissues and the vascular channels (the capillaries). However, before discussing the function of the part of the circulatory system, it is important to describe the system as a whole.  
 
Figure 2 -6 — Circulation (Transportation)  
 
 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 15 
Anatomy and Phys iology of the Circulatory System  
The heart (Figure 2 -7) consists of four chambers, but functions 
as two pumps in series — one to  propel blood through the lungs, 
exchanging O 2 and CO 2 (the pulmonary circulation) and one to 
drive blood to all other tissues of the body (systemic circulation). 
Unidirectional flow through the heart is achieved by an 
arrangement of flap -like valves. Although the blood is pumped 
by the heart intermittently, continuous flow to the tissues is 
achieved by expansion and recoil of the arteries.  
Vasculature  
Blood flows from the larger arterial vessels into progressively smaller arteries and finally into the arterioles. Since the size of 
the arterioles can be altered, tissue blood flow and arterial blood 
pressure may be regulated. Even smaller vessels, the capillaries, 
branch out from a single arteriole so that the cross -sectional area 
of the capillary bed is very large. As a result, blood flow becomes quite slow. Since the capillaries are normally short, have walls 
which are only one cell thick, and a slow flow rate, conditions 
are ideal for diffusion of substances between blood and tissue  
(Figure 2 -8).  
On its return to the heart from the capillaries, blood passes through a series of progressively larger veins. However, as the 
heart is  approached, the number of veins decreases, 
progressively reducing the cross -sectional area of the venous 
channels, which consequently increases the velocity of blood flow. Blood entering the right ventricle via the right atrium is then pumped through the pulmonary arterial system at a reduced 
pressure. The blood then passes through the pulmonary 
capillaries in the lungs where CO2 is released and O2 i s taken 
up. Finally, the oxygen- rich blood returns via the pulmonary 
veins to the left atrium and ventricle to complete the cycle. 
Circulation and blood volume remain relatively (i.e. a closed 
loop system) constant and an increase in the volume of blood in one area must be accompanied by a decrease in another.  
Blood circulates through the cardiovascular system i n a mixture 
of cells within a liquid called plasma. The cells of the blood 
serve multiple functions essential for metabolism and defense 
of the body. However, in the brief discussion which follows, 
only O2 and CO2 delivery within blood will be discussed.  
In the normal human adult, plasma makes up approximately 55 
percent of the blood. The cellular constituents of blood include 
red blood cells, a variety of white blood cells, and platelets  
(Figure 2 -9).

Red Blood Cells  (Figure 2-10) — The primary purpose of the red blood cell (RBC) is to transport O 2 and CO 2. It 
accomplishes this due to its unique shape. RBCs are small biconcave, circular disks. They function as a transport 
mechanism for gases in particular oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is the hemoglobin in t he RBCs that is responsible for 
this activity. Each RBC contains up to 300 million hemoglobin molecules. This gives RBCs a substantial oxygen carrying capacity. Although the hemoglobin can carry CO
2, it usually does not. The main function of hemoglobin is to transport 
oxygen.

Utilization Phase  
Metabolism is the sum of chemical and physical processes which maintain life . Essentially, the body acquires energy 
input from nutritional sources, and then utilizes metabolic processes to convert the chemical energy to  mechanical  and 
thermal energy (Figure 2 -11). 
 
Figure 2 -11 — Utilization Phase  
Factors Affecting Oxygen Delivery to the Tissues  
Several aviation -related factors can affect the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. A lack of oxygen in body tissues that is 
sufficient to cause an impairment of function is called hypoxia.  
1. Altitude  — An increase in altitude will reduce the PO 2 of inspired air causing hypoxic hypoxia . 
2. G-forces  — Blood pooling in the lower extremities during increased G maneuvering can cause stagnant hypoxia, 
another factor that can reduce oxygen delivery to tissues.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 17 
3. Toxic gases or substance  — Various types of toxic gases or substance s can cause the blood to carry less oxygen 
(hypemic hypoxia ) or the tissues to be unable to take up or use oxygen ( histotoxic hypoxia).  
The effect of these factors is cumulative on t he body and can and have resulted in aircraft mishaps.  
Summary  
The respiratory and circulatory systems are the primary means by which we bring oxygen and other vital nutrients to the 
different parts of the body and remove carbon dioxide and other waste products from the body. Respiration as a whole 
involves a five phase process with diffusion happening in two phases  — ventilation, diffusion, transportation, diffusion, 
and utilization. Ventilation involves inhalation and exhalation through the oral- nasal cavity and trachea to the lungs. Gas 
is exchanged at the alveolar level within the lung. Normal ventilation is controlled subconsciously and adapts to changes 
in PCO 2, PO 2, and pH.  
The next phase of respiration, transportation, is accomplished by the circulatory system. The heart serves as the pump moving the blood throughout the body and through the lungs for gas exchange. The blood is made up of plasma and three 
types of blood cells. Of these blood cells, it is the red blood cells that contain the oxygen -carrying chemical hemoglobin. 
In aviation , altitude, G forces, and toxic gasses all have the potential to affect th e ability of the respiratory and circulatory 
systems to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen to the tissues. When this lack of oxygen reaches a level where by it begins 
to impair function , this is called hypoxia. Hypoxia, as well as the other physiological th reats associated with altitude, is 
discussed in the next lesson.

Introduction 
We have examined the atmosphere and how the respiratory and circulatory systems work together to support life. Now, 
we need to address ho w the changes in atmospheric pressure will affect your body during flight.  The following topics 
will cover hypoxia, hyperventilation, trapped gas problems, and decompression sickness, which are all distresses a person 
can experience with increased  altitude  the associated pressure changes.  We will also discuss how cabin pressurization 
will help prevent most of these hazards.  
Information  
Hypoxia  
Hypoxia is an oxygen (O 2) deficiency sufficient to cause impairment of function. It occurs most frequently when 
protection against the fall in O 2 partial pressure at altitude fails.  The insidious onset is hypoxia’s most dangerous 
characteristic. Hypoxia symptoms do not normally cause discomfort.  In fact, many individuals perceive their symptoms 
as quite pleasant. Durin g a slow decompression (where the cabin altitude gradually increases), hypoxia has a slow onset 
and the symptoms may be well developed before you recognize them.  In some cases, you may not recognize hypoxia and 
become impaired to the point of no longer bei ng able to recover on your own.  Hypoxia can occur at any altitude and at 
any time . There are four types of hypoxia: hypoxic hypoxia , hypemic hypoxia , stagnant hypoxia, and histotoxic hypoxia. 
In the following paragraphs, each form of hypoxia is defined and discussed in relation to its impact on oxygen delivery 
and utilization.  
Hypoxic Hypoxia 
Hypoxic hypoxia results when there is a reduction of the PO 2 in the lungs. Hypoxic hypoxia is usually caused by exposure 
to low barometric pressure and is frequently r eferred to as altitude hypoxia . This reduced oxygen partial pressure can 
result from oxygen equipment malfunctions, improper use of oxygen equipment, and loss of cabin pressurization at 
altitude.  
The altitude threshold for hypoxic hypoxia is generally con sidered 10,000 feet MSL.  
Factors Influencing Hypoxic Hypoxia  
There are several factors that influence the development of hypoxic hypoxia. The altitude of the cabin is a factor.  The 
cabin altitude of the aircraft  can determine how quickly hypoxia is experienced.  The time spent at altitude also has a 
direct correlation to the effects of hypoxia. The effects of an exposure become more detrimental as exposure time 
increases at a higher  altitude.  At lower levels (around 10,000 feet) you might not notice your sym ptoms for quite some 
time.  It could take hours and your symptoms would come on slowly.  Because of the low PO 2 above 10,000 feet MSL, 
the USAF require s supplemental oxygen for flight above a cabin altitude of 10,000 feet.  
The rate of pressure change could  also be a factor . Rapid decompression may reduce alveolar pressure below that of 
arterial blood, thereby reversing the direction of O 2 diffusion so that the blood is actually giving up O 2 through the lungs.  
There are variations in a person’s tolerance to hy poxia due to an individual’s personal physiology. The reasons are not 
completely understood but an individual’s metabolic rate and acclimatization to altitude are important factors.  Physical 
activity du ring the flight can be a factor . Metabolic oxygen requirements are increased several times during exercise. The 
physical activity factor is most significant if you are required to be active while performing crew duties. For example, 
flying a contact mission and pulling Gz is more strenuous than flying a high altitude navigation mission. Lastly, a person’s 
life-style affects  all facets of your flying environment, including tolerance to hypoxia. Often, crewmembers impose 
unnecessary stresses upon themselves through tobacco use, poor sleep patterns, excessive alcohol consumption, improper 
diet, etc. Self -imposed stress and its overall impact on the crewmember  will be discussed in detail in a subsequent lesson.  
Recognition of Hypoxic Hypoxia  
One of the reasons you attend Aerospace Physiology training is to witness other crewmembers’ signs and to experience your own hypoxic hypoxia symptoms in a controlled environment. This experience enables you to identify signs of 
hypoxia in fellow crewmembers and experience your own individual symptoms.  The warning signals most i mportant to 
you are those you actually feel or sense.  They are emphasized to help you recognize hypoxia during flight.  
According to the Handbook or Aerospace and Operational Physiology  (2016), common s igns of hypoxia  can often be 
recognized by anoth er indi vidual. These include c yanosis (blue lips/fingernails) , degrade d reaction time , euphoria 
(feeling/state of intense excitement and  happiness) , belligerence , impaired judgment , increased respiration (increased 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 22 
rate and depth of breathing), m ental confusion , muscle incoordination , unconsciousness , or d ysphoria (state of unease or 
generalized dissatisfaction) . 
Symptoms are the warning signals most important to the crewmember. These are the symptoms only you  can actually 
sense and identify. Sympto ms are emphasized as a means for crewmembers to recognize their own hypoxia indicators 
during flight. Hypoxia symptoms  are very individualized and can include air hunger  (oxygen want) , apprehension, 
dizziness, fatigue,  headache,  hot/cold flashes , or lightheadedness  (dizz y sensation) . Other symptoms may also include 
nausea, numbness, tingling in extremities, tunnel vision, visual impairment, euphoria, and dysphoria. The altitude 
chamber hypoxia demonstrations allow you to experience your own personal symptoms so you may identify hypoxia 
should it happen to you in the aircraft.  
Because hypoxic hypoxia does not usually cause physical pain or discomfort, it can be difficult to detect. Ultimately, it 
can creep up on you before you realize that something is wrong. This difficult y can be exacerbated when mentally focused 
on completing a task. Without running a consistent mental checklist of the human system, threats such as hypoxia are more likely to have greater negative repercussions.  
Time of Useful Consciousness  (TUC)  is the pe riod of time from the interruption of the oxygen supply or exposure to an 
oxygen poor environment, to the time when useful function is lost (Reinhart, 2008)  (Figure 3 -1). You are no longer 
capable of taking proper corrective and protective action, but are still conscious. It is not  the time to total unconsciousness.  
 
Figure 3 -1 — Time of Useful C onsciousness  
Common factors that affect TUC are:  
Acclimatization  
Altitude  
Rate of ascent  
Duration at altitude  
Exertion at altitude  
Environmental temperature  
Indivi dual tolerance  
Physical fitness  
Self-imposed stresses (alcohol, fatigue, etc.)  
Medication and drugs  
At higher altitudes, the TUC becomes very short. Figure 3 -2 shows mean TUC for resting individuals at various altitudes. 
Exercise or stress will reduce thes e times. Additionally, a rapid decompression can reduce TUC up to 50 percent (DeHart, 
1996). For example, at FL350, the mean TUC
  is approximately 30 to 60 seconds. After a rapid decompression, the mean 
TUC would only be 15 to 30 seconds.

Precautionary Actions for Hypoxic Hypoxia  
Cabin pressurization  is the most common means of preventing hypoxia , which will be discussed in the next block, Cabin 
Pressurization. To be proactive in case you experience hypoxia, you  will need to  know how to use YOUR oxygen 
equipment, preflight your oxygen equipment, and know your symptoms ! 
Treatment of Hypoxic Hypoxia  
First step in treatment of hypoxia is verifying your oxygen equipment works prior to take off.  You are responsible fo r 
your own oxygen equipment. You must ensure your equipment is working correctly prior to take off. Always preflight 
your helmet and oxygen mask at the life support shop to ensure correct function. If problems are detected, they can be 
corrected prior to r eaching the aircraft.  Once in the aircraft, thoroughly preflight your oxygen regulators and systems 
prior to takeoff. After the aircraft is airborne, additional checks are required to ensure the aircraft oxygen and 
pressurization systems are functioning co rrectly. Please reference your Dash 1 . 
Immediate corrective actions must be taken when hypoxia symptoms are recognized or when a decompression occurs. 
100 percent oxygen must be administered through an oxygen mask. The type of mask and delivery system used depends 
on the aircraft flown, your crew position,  and your immediate location in the aircraft during the emergency. Specific 
corrective actions are listed in each aircraft’s flight manual. The following procedures are generalized to include 
corrective actions for all the aircraft used in joint undergraduate flying training.  
1. Maximum Oxygen Under Pressure —Your first prio rity 
when correcting for physiological symptoms  is to obtain 
oxygen. When using narrow p anel pressure demand -type 
regulator s, like those found in the T -6 and the altitude chamber, 
this is accomplished by placing all three s witches in the f ull-up 
position  (Figure 3 -3), which should resolve conditions within a 
few breaths.  This is known as “Gangloading” the regulator. For 
speed, the procedure should be accomplished with a single sweep of the hand. “Gangloading” the regulator will place it in the On, 100 percent/Max oxygen, emergency pressure setting.  
Note  — If you suspect a problem with your aircraft oxygen 
supply or regulator, you may need to activate an alternate oxygen system (such as an emergency oxygen cylinder located in a parachute or seat kit in a single/dual -seat aircraft and 
the yellow walk aroun d bottle or protective breathing equipment located in multi- place aircraft).  
2. Connections - Check Security  — Equipment function, connections and oxygen system pressures must be quickly 
evaluated when hypoxia symptoms are recognized or suspected. Equipmen t preflight and frequent in -flight monitoring 
will reduce the occurrence of hypoxia.  
Note  — Immediately after completing the first two steps of your emergency procedures, communicate with fellow 
crewmembers.  
3. Breathe at a Rate and Depth Slightly Less Tha n Normal Until Symptoms Disappear  — Recovery from hypoxia 
usually occurs in a few seconds following the administration of 100 percent oxygen. However, if the cause of hypoxia is 
*Rapid decompression can reduce TUC up to 50%

smoke , fumes , or chemicals, the recovery period may be considerably longer. Fo r this reason it is imperative to continue 
breathing 100 percent oxygen. Your respiratory rat e may increase because of anxiety from the incident. If your respiratory 
rate is not controlled, hyperventilation may result,  causing hypocapnia.  Respiration monit oring should be accomplished 
simultaneously with the initial corre ctive steps. Monitor and control your rate and depth of breathing to prevent 
hyperventilation during recovery from hypoxia. If your symptoms have been caused by hyperventilation rather than 
hypoxia, monitoring your rate and depth of breathing should eliminate them.  
4. Descend Below 10,000 F eet and Land as Soon as Practical  — If your symptoms persist after completing the initial 
corrective steps, descend below 10,000 feet MSL. Descending will not counteract hyperventilation and you must continue 
to monitor your rate and depth of breathing.  
Pressure Breathing  
Pressure Breathing delivers oxygen, under pressure, through the crewmember’s oxygen mask. It is a method of 
maintaining adequate PO 2 in the lungs at cabin altitudes above 40,000 f eet (Figure 3 -4). 
The aircraft oxygen system provides an increased fraction of oxygen as cabin altitude is increased above 1,000 f eet. 
Breathing 100 percent oxygen at FL340 is equivalent to breathing ambient air at sea level. Above FL400 (cabin altitude), breathing 100 percent oxygen alone is not adequate to prevent hypoxia and positive pressure breathing is needed.  
 
Figure 3 -4 — Maintaining PO2 with pressure breathing  
Pressure breathing has limitations. It reverses  the normal breathing cycles; inspiration becomes passive and expiration 
now requires active effort. Over -inflation of the lungs from pressure breathing inhibits exhalation and reduces venous 
return to the heart. This reduction in venous return may result in stagnant hypoxia and is the most limiting factor of 
pressure breathing.  
Note  — Hyperventilation/hypocapnia may occur during pressure breathing if you do not control your rate and depth of 
breathing. Pausing between breathing phases will help prevent hyp erventilation and can be learned with practice in the 
altitude chamber. Familiarize yourself with the process to minimize or eliminate problems when treating for hypoxia 
symptoms or following a loss of cabin pressurization.  
Oxygen Paradox  
In addition to pr essure breathing , another potential result of gangloading is the human body’s response to the sudden 
influx of 100% oxygen. The result of this is a condition known as oxygen paradox. Although providing oxygen to an extremely hypoxic individual is essential for recovery, symptoms may, at first, seem to get worse, with the individual 
feeling dizzy and nauseated, and even trying to remove an oxygen mask. In severe cases, breathing may cease entirely for many seconds after a deep breath of oxygen.  
These are symptoms of oxygen paradox and usually pass quickly. The cause of oxygen paradox is believed to be 
hypocapnia resulting from hyperventilation during hypoxia. As a result, plasma carbon dioxide is insufficient to drive the respiratory reflex. During hypoxia, oxygen drives respiration. The first breath of oxygen eliminates this drive, and many seconds pass before carbon dioxide builds up enough to again drive respiration. Oxygen administration also affects 
capillary flow control and causes transient reductions i n blood pressure, leading to dizziness and nausea. Once again, 
these symptoms l ast until cardiovascular effects have passed and  CO
2 returns to normal  
Hypemic Hypoxia 
Hypemic Hypoxia is when the O 2 carrying capacity of the blood is reduced.  This type of hypoxia affects O 2 delivery by 
reducing the functional hemoglobin available for transporting O 2. Certain drugs and chemicals can combine with or alter 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 25 
the characteristics of hemoglobin and reduce its O 2 carrying capacity. For example, hemoglobin has an affini ty for carbon 
monoxide (CO) about 200 – 250 times greater than O 2. 
The threat of inhaling carbon monoxide from smoke or fumes in the cockpit can be mitigated by using 100 percent 
oxygen.  Smoking cigarettes prior to flight increases the amount of CO in the bloodstream and raises your physiological 
altitude.  Then you become more susceptible to hypoxic hypoxia because of the preexisting hypemic hypoxia.  Blood 
donation and bleeding injuries also deplete the RBC/hemoglobin supply and cause hypemic hypoxia.  
Stagn ant Hypoxia  
Stagnant hypoxia occurs when reduction in cardiac output, pooling of the blood, or restriction of blood flow reduces O 2 
delivery  (Figure 3 -5). Several conditions cause stagnant hypoxia. Two of these will be discussed in detail during 
subsequent  instruction  — hyperventilation and acceleration (G forces). Stagnant hypoxia can also be caused by shock 
(blood pooling in dilated blood vessels) or cold temperatures (constricting the blood vessels of the extremities, causing 
pooling of blood in the body  core). Even sitting very still for long periods of time can result in stagnant hypoxia. An 
individual passing out while standing in formation is an example of stagnant hypoxia.  
 
Figure 3 -5 — Reduced Blood Flow  
Histotoxic Hypoxia 
Histotoxic hypoxia r esult s when the O 2 delivered to the cells cannot be used for energy production. Adequate O 2 is 
available to the lungs and the blood is capable of carrying it to the tissues. However, the tissues and cells are unable to 
use the available O 2. 
The primary cause of  histotoxic hypoxia in a crewmember is cyanide.  Cyanide, in the form of hydrogen cyanide gas 
(HCN), is a byproduct of the combustion of plastics, insulation, seat covers, and other synthetic substances found on 
aircraft.  HCN is highly toxic and extremely s mall concentrations (300 parts per million) cause incapacitation within 
seconds; death occurs within minutes. Therefore, you must not hesitate in donning oxygen equipment and breathing 100 
percent oxygen.  If you suspect contamination of the primary O 2 system, activate the emergency O 2 system . Remember: 
Symptoms may be slow to go away . Follow procedures outlined in flight manuals / checklists . 
There are components of hydraulic fluids, oils, and jet fuels which can be distributed within the cockpit in mist fo rm. 
These fumes can impose inhalat ion and eye irritation problems . Additionally, e xcessive temperatures in electrical 
equipment may cause thermal breakdown of the equipment which could cause hazardous fumes.  
Secondary causes of histotoxic hypoxia are alcoh ol and some medications.  To reduce  the possibility of mishaps, AFMAN  
11-202, Volume 3, Flight Operations , restricts alcohol consumption 12 hours prior to flight. USAF instructions restrict 
medication unless prescribed by a flight surgeon.  
Hypocapnia  
Hyperv entilation  is a condition in which the rate and depth of breathing is abnormally increased. This increase causes an 
excessive loss of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the blood which is called hypocapnia . 
Hypocapnia  at Altitude  
Lung and blood O 2 partial pressure is reduced below minimum acceptable levels with hypoxia onset above 10,000 feet. 
Decreased O 2 levels stimulate the respiratory center via chemoreceptors in the aorta and carotid arteries. This stimulation 
causes increased breathing in an attempt to make up  for O 2 deficiency. Hypocapnia, or the state of reduced carbon dioxide 
in the blood, occurs if the resulting hyperventi lation is permitted to continue , creating a constriction of blood vessels 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 26 
leading to the brain. This vasoc onstriction reduces circulation  within the brain and d ecreased O 2 causes stagnant hypoxia 
in brain tissues. Unconsciousness may result from the cumulative effects of hypoxic and stagnant hypoxia of brain tissues . 
Pausing between breathing phases will help prevent hyperventilation and ca n be learned with practice in the altitude 
chamber. Familiarize yourself with the process to minimize or eliminate problems when treating for hypoxia symptoms 
or following a loss of cabin pressurization.  
Pressure B reathing and H ypocapnia  
Active inhalations  and passive exhalations characterize normal breathing cycles. As previously mentioned, pressure 
breathing from an O 2 regulator actually reverses the breathing cycle; inspiration becomes passive and expiration now 
requires active effort. Over -inflation of the lungs from pressure breathing inhibits exhalation and reduces venous return 
to the heart. This reduction in venous return may result in stagnant hypoxia and is the most limiting factor of pressure 
breathing.  
Additionally, this reversed breathi ng cycle can cause hyperventilation . You can prevent hyperventilation by controlling 
the rate and depth of breathing while pressure breathing. It is important to be prepare d for the possibility of being 
uncomfortable and the unfamiliar sensation of breathing under positive pressure. To counteract the positive p ressure from 
the regulator, you should allow the air to fill your  lungs, pause, and then forcefully exhale against the pressure.  
Emotional Causes  
Fear, anxiety, stress, or tension, resulting from emotional or physical discomfort sometimes causes the normal control of 
breathing to be overridden. These factors are the most frequent causes of hyperventilation.  Pay particular attention to 
possible increased rates of breathing during initial flying sorties or whenever new flying techniques are encountered or 
stressful situations are experienced.  Changes in breathing can occur very insidiously.  
While hypoc apnia occurs more frequently with inexperienced crewmembers, it will remain a potential hazard throughout 
your fly ing career.  Always be aware of the possibility of hyp ocapnia. 
Recognition and Prevention of Hypoc apnia 
Signs  most often observed in hypoc apnia are increased rate of breathing, muscle tightness and twitching, paleness, cold 
clammy skin, muscle spasms, rigid ity and unconsciousness.  Symptoms  most often noted are dizziness, faintness, slight 
nausea, numbness, tingling or coolness and muscle tremors. The most effective way to prevent hypocapnia is to control 
your rate and depth of breathing.  Continually monitor your rate and depth of breathing, especially during stressful 
situations.  
Treatment of Hy pocapnia  
Many symptoms we experience are so similar that it is hard to determine the cause. As seen i n Figure 3 -6, hypoxia, toxic 
exposure, hypoglycemia, dehydration,  hypoc apnia, and hypercapnia, all have very similar symptoms. The most 
dangerous of the conditions is hypoxia whose conditions can be so similar to hypocapnia and the other conditions that 
they may be hard to distinguish.  
 
Figure 3 -6 — Causes of Physio logical  Symptoms  
Not only are hypoxia and hypocapnia hard to distinguish, there are many other physiologic symptoms that make it hard 
to determine their causes as well.  This can confuse diagnosis and potentially delay treatment. In an emergency or

UNCLASSIFIED 27 
uncertain  environment (e.g. in flight), time should not be wasted attempting to distinguish causes of symptoms. Therefore,  
all physiological symptoms are treated the same.  
Treat All Physiologic al Symptoms the Same  
Since physiological symptoms (e.g., hypocapnia, hypoxia)  may be confused or occur at the same time,  immediate 
corrective actions are required  and will resolve any of them . As corrective procedures are being implemented, remember  
symptoms may be slow to resolve . 
At the most elementary level, the treatment o f hypoxia involves providing oxygen. Following the appropriate MDS 
BOLDFACE procedures should provide  oxygen and restore  normal breathing rate and depth, thus treating all 
physiological symptoms simultaneously and without delay.

Trapped Gas Disorders  
Boyle’s Law states the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the ambient pressure.  Therefore, changes in ambient 
pressure during flight will result in changes in the volume of body gases, in other words, expansion of gases during ascent and contraction of gases during descent.  
The human body can withstand these changes, including expanding gas pressure buildup, when the pressure can be 
relieved.  Howeve r, when the pressure cannot be relieved or the expanding gas cannot escape; then the gas is considered 
“trapped.”  With further decrease of ambient pressure (ascent), a greater increase in volume or pressure within the cavity 
 
Figure 3 -7 — Emergency O 2 Handle  
“Green Ring”  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 28 
occurs.  These increases someti mes result in pain. Figure 3 -8 shows the areas 
most often affected by the change in pressure: middle ear , sinuses, GI tract , 
and teeth . 
Middle Ear Trapped Gas  
To understand why the pressure builds in the middle ear and how to resolve 
it appropriately, we n eed to discuss the anatomy of the middle ear.  The 
middle ear cavity is connected to the throat by  the Eustachian tube (Figure 
3-9). The Eustachian tube has a slit -like opening at the throat end, allowing 
middle ear air pressures to vent outwardly more easi ly than inwardly. During 
ascent, excess pressure in the middle ear caused by gas expansion will escape 
through the unobstructed Eustachian tube with little or no effort.  The 
released pressure is often accompanied by a physical “click” in the ears.  
During d escent, however, the opening of the Eustachian tube acts as a one -
way flapper valve and resists equalization of ambient and middle ear air 
pressures. The increased ambient pressure forces the eardrum inward and 
you must assist the equalization process.  
Equalizing air pressure in the ear during descent may be accomplished by 
swallowing, yawning, tensing the muscles in the throat, moving the head 
from side to side, extending the jaw forward,  or rocking the jaw from side to 
side. However, the most effective w ay to equalize the pressure in the middle 
ear is the use of the Valsalva maneuver . The Valsalva maneuver will 
force air into the middle ear by closing the mouth tight enough to no t let 
air pass into the mouth, pinching the nose closed  and forcefully exhali ng. 
This method forces air through the previously closed Eustachian tube 
and equalizes the pressure differential between the middle ear and the 
atmosphere.  Practice in clearing the ears can improve and sustain the rate 
of descent without discomfort.  Some c rewmembers find they must use 
the Valsalva maneuver frequently during descent without waiting for a 
sensation of discomfort.  Others use the Valsalva maneuver as soon as 
they recognize fullness, ringing of the ears, decreased ability to hear or 
pain.  With e xperience you will develop your own technique, but it is best 
to not wait until you feel pain before you accomplish the Valsalva maneuver.  
Problems with the ears occur more often at altitudes closer to the earth’s 
surface where there are greater pressure changes. If the pressure 
differential of the atmosphere over the middle ear exceeds 80 mmHg, it 
may be impossible to open the Eustachian tube with equalization pressure methods.  This condition is known as an ear 
block  (barotitis media). An ear block may be defined as an acute or chronic traumatic inflammation of the middle ear 
produced by a pressure differential (either positive or negative) between the air in the tympanic cavity and contiguous air spaces and that  of the surrounding atmosphere . If descent is  continued, increasing pain and eardrum rupture will result. 
Prior to eardrum rupture, relief from pain can best be obtained by ascending to an altitude where pressure equalization 
methods can be used; a slow descent is then recommended.  If an eardrum is r uptured, most pain will cease and healing 
normally occurs in 3 to 5 weeks.  This condition should always be reported to your flight surgeon.  
An ear block is characterized by congestion, inflammation, discomfort, pain, and is usually followed by a temporary impairment of hearing. The Eustachian tube opening is restricted by inflammation or infection from a head cold, allergy, 
sore throat, infection of the middle ear, sinusitis,  or tonsillitis. Forceful opening of the tube under these conditions may 
introduce infection into the middle ear and cause severe ear problems. In addition, infection can cause difficulty in 
clearing the ears resulting in sudden pressure changes. These pressure changes in the middle ear can affect the vestibular 
system of the inner ear, causing dizziness or disruption of equilibrium referred to as pressure vertigo. If you are suffering 
from upper respiratory infections, apparent allergic reactions or any congestion, you should not fly or participate in an altitude chamber flight . Consult a flight surgeon.  
A delayed ear block  (post-flight ear block)  can occur up to 2 to 6 hours after landing. It results from breathing high 
percent oxygen for an extended period of time.  As oxygen
 diffuses out of the middle ear into the surrounding tissues, a  
relative low pressure area results.  The low pressure area allows the now greater ambient pressure on the exterior surface 
of the ear drum to deflect the ear drum inward, dulling the hearing and producing pain.  Performing the Valsalva maneuver 
several times after flight can prevent a delayed ear block.

UNCLASSIFIED 29 
Sinuses  
Sinuses are another area where pressure can get “trapped.” The sinuses are cavities 
housed within the bones of the skull and are lined with mo ist mucous membranes 
(Figure 3 -10). Sinuses vent to the a tmosphere through tiny slit -like openings into 
the nasal cavity.  Under normal circumstances, the pressure is equal to the outside 
barometric pressure. The sinuses most frequently affected by pressure changes are 
the frontal sinuses, located above and behin d each eye, and the maxillary sinuses, 
located in the bones of the cheeks beneath the eyes.  
When pressure changes occur during ascent or descent, the gases in the sinuses increase or decrease in volume.  Normally, sinuses vent with no discomfort.  
However, i f the sinus ducts are swollen because of an upper respiratory infection, 
there may be a blockage of the ducts.  This condition is called a sinus block . On 
ascent, blockage at the opening of the duct may prevent the expanding gas from venting to the outside,  and localized pain will occur. However, blockage occurs 
more often on descent when the pressure difference across the duct is increased without relief.  To prevent pain during descent, pressure must be equalized as 
rapidly as possible to relieve the differ ential and discomfort. The degree of pain will naturally depend on the pressure 
across the duct.  The onset of sinus pain due to barometric pressure change is rapid.  The Valsalva maneuver will usually 
alleviate the problem. If necessary, relief from pain can be obtained by ascending to an altitude where pressure 
equalization can be accomplished.  
Blockage of the ducts leading to the maxillary sinuses may be mistaken for upper tooth pain because of their proximity 
to the upper teeth.  All of the upper teeth wil l be affected as opposed to one isolated tooth and may be treated like any 
other sinus block.  If isolated tooth problems continue on ascent, discomfort can be resolved by descent and landing. The 
flight surgeon and dent ist should be consulted after the fli ght. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract  
A problem that may be experienced with a decrease in atmospheric pressure is discomfort from expansion of gases in the GI tract.  This problem is not usually serious at low altitudes. However, at the higher altitudes, enough  expansion may 
occur to produce pain.  Extreme discomfort may result unless the pressure is relieved by belching and or passing flatus. 
Sometimes relief is only gained by descent.  
Crewmembers participating regularly in unpressurized high altitude flights sh ould learn to avoid foods they know 
disagree with them.  These foods may include onions, cabbage, raw apples, radishes, dried beans, cucumbers, melons,  
and carbonated beverages.  Eating irregularly or hastily also makes a crewmember more susceptible to gas p ains. To 
reduce your chances of GI tract problems before flights, avoid hasty, irregular, and heavy meals, especially foods and beverages you know produce excess gas.  
Teeth  
Tooth pain, or barodontalgia, is also a case of a trapped gas exerting positive or negative pressure on surrounding tissue. Rarely, a bubble can be seen on x -ray in the vicinity of an affected tooth, but more often there is no obvious source of 
pressure. It is believed that microbubbles trapped in small fractures or under a recent fillin g may be enough to exert 
pressure on the nerve in the tooth pulp. Tooth pain can also be caused by maxillary polyps that block sinus equalization, resulting in sinus block that can exert pressure on a nerve leading to a tooth.  
The altitude at which the ons et of tooth pain usually occurs varies. Pain in a given tooth often may show remarkable 
constancy in the altitude at which it first becomes manifest. The pain may or may not become more severe as altitude increases. Descent invariably brings relief, the pain often disappearing at the same altitude at which it was first observed. 
The incidence of barodontalgia is low, but when it occurs, it is usually quite severe and causes excruciating pain. If 
problems occur, descend and see a flight surgeon/dentist.  
Gas Movement in the Lungs  
Lung overinflation due to breath- holding or inadequate equalization of pressure during decompression, can result in 
serious problems, such as pulmonary embolism (air in arterial circulation), pneumothorax (air in pleural cavity), or pneumomediastinum (air in the mediastinum). In animal studies, intrapulmonary pressure differentials of 80 – 100 mmHg 
(1.5 – 1.9 psi) occurring in 0.1 –  0.2 seconds ha s led to alveolar rupture (Barratt & Pool, 2008). Pulmonary overpressure 
may occur if a rapid decompression happens during breath- holding, swallowing, or yawning. Fortunately, the chances of 
the glottis being closed, and maintained in such a state, during a rapid decompression is extremely rare ( Luft & Bancroft , 
1956).

Decompression Sickness  
One of the most potentially dangerous effects of exposure to high cabin altitudes is decompression sickness  (DCS). DCS 
is the disorder produced by the evolution of gas from tissues and fluids of the body (nitrogen bubble formation).  
Henry’s Law states the am ount of gas in a solution varies directly with the partial pressure of that gas over the solution. 
When the atmospheric pressure is decreased, the pressure difference between gases dissolved in body fluids and the 
ambient air may cause dissolved gases to come out of solution in the form of bubbles. This process can occur in the 
blood, other body fluids, and or body tissues.  
Types of DCS and Their Symptoms  
The evolution of nitrogen bubbles can manifest many places in the body.  The most common places are the body’s joints, 
central nervo us system, lungs, and the skin.  The joints are the most common place and has the nickname of “The Bends .” 
The e volution of nitrogen bubbles into the joints of the body causes pain.  The pain is generally localized in and around 
the joints of the body. The smaller joints, of the fingers for example, can be involved; however, the larger joints like the 
shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles are the usual sites. The pain is variable in nature and may occur suddenly. It is 
usually a deep, dull, and boring pain. Factors such as exercise, time at altitude, and increased altitude influence the degree 
of pain. With time, the pain may spread and seem to involve the muscles. Movement of the affected joint tends to increase the discomfort.  
Treatment for joint pain  or “The Bends ” is to descen d below the altitude of occurrence will usually decrease or resolve 
the pain. Continued descent is required even if the pain completely resolves on initial descent. Ascent to the same altitude 
will cause the pain to return in the same location. Increasing the total barometric pressure on the body is the only effective 
means of eliminating bends. Any painful condition at high altitude is potentially dangerous and should be avoided.. Once 
bends have developed, breathing 100 percent oxygen while at altitude will not normally resolve the pain. Descent is the only cure and is mandatory for any DCS.  
In rare incidents of high altitude exposure, the brain and or spinal cord (the central nervous system)  may be affected by 
nitrogen bubbles. Although rare, it is potentially very dangerous.  The most common symptoms are very similar to those 
of a stroke: disturbances in vision, varying from blind spots in the visual field to flashing and or flickering lights. Other  
symptoms include severe persistent headache, partial paralysis, loss of speech or hearing, vertigo, distinct sudden 
personality changes,  or loss of orientation. Numbness and tingling of one arm, leg, or side of the body may occur. One 
explanation for these symptoms  theorizes the bubbles of evolved nitrogen circulate through the brain, reducing blood 
flow and causing localized, small regions of the brain to become hypoxic. These symptoms are attributed to abnormal brain function in the areas of localized hypoxia.  
Since these problems affect the brain or spinal cord, they are considered the most dangerous and are known as central 
nervous system (CNS) manifestations. Circulatory shock, or failure of circulatory control, is a possible effect of neurological involvement. Typical symptoms of circulatory shock or circulatory failure are pale clammy skin, feeble rapid pulse, decreased breathing, and unconsciousness. Blood pressure may fall with severe blood pooling and resultant 
stagnant hypoxia. Immediate descent is necessar y after any evidence of CNS involvement.  
Rare but p otentially very dangerous, the nitrogen can manifest in the lungs often referred to as “ The Chokes .” The 
symptoms are very similar to those of a heart attack, and may be misdiagnosed if they are presented to a civilian physician.  
The causes of chokes symptoms are not fully understood. One hypothesis is that bubbles evolve in the smaller blood 
vessels in the lungs and in the tissue of the trachea (windpipe). The symptoms are deep sharp pain centrally located  under 
the sternum (breast bone), a dry nonproductive  cough, and difficulty with inspiration. Increased expansion of the lungs 
causes the pain to increase and there is a sense of suffocation and apprehension. Symptoms of shock may appear  — 
sweating, pallor , faintness, and cyanosis may be observed. Immediate descent is necessary and post flight shock is a 
possibility. The chokes symptoms may disappear with the descent but there can be some residual soreness in the chest 
and the crewmember should receive immediate post flight medical attention.  
Note  — False chokes  may be experienced by crewmembers who are exposed to prolonged breathing of dry, aviator’s 
oxygen. False chokes are nonhazardous and represent a drying of the mucous membrane linings. Symptoms are a dry nonproductive cough and minor tissue irritation. They are quickly resolved by breathing moist air or by drinking water.  
One type of DCS involves peculiar sensations of the skin sometimes called “ Creeps .” In some instances, a mottled, 
reddish,  or purpli sh rash develops on the skin. The rash may be localized in a small area or may be diffused over the 
body. A slight swelling of the skin may be noted and a slight increase of temperature may exist. The rash may not 
disappear with descent and may last for ho urs. Skin manifestations of DCS may indicate bubbles in and around the skin 
or possibly bubbles affecting the peripheral nerves of the spinal column. Skin manifestations should be considered a 
serious type of DCS because of the possibility of CNS involveme nt.

UNCLASSIFIED 31 
It is important for you to realize there is no predictable progression of symptoms. It is possible to have several of the 
symptoms at the same time.  
Occasionally, the onset of DCS symptoms may appear after the flight. This condition is known as a delay ed DCS  and 
may occur within 24  hours. As always, treatment must be initiated and the affected individual referred to the flight 
surgeon.  
Factors Affecting DCS Incidence and Severity  
Decompression is not the only controlling factor in the evolution of nitro gen. There are other important factors which 
help to explain the unpredictably of bubble formation and DCS.  
Increasing the altitude  contributes to an increased incidence of DCS. Considerable debate surrounds the minimum, or 
threshold altitude for DCS. Alth ough no precise boundary exists, studies have shown an abrupt increase in altitude DCS 
(without pre -oxygenation exposure) at about 21,200 feet (MSL).  
A faster rate of ascent  to altitude contributes to a greater incidence of DCS. For example, you are more s usceptible to 
DCS after a rapid decompression than you would be from a slow decompression to the same altitude.  
Note  — Cabin pressurization systems protect against DCS by keeping the body below 25,000 feet cabin altitude. 
However, mechanical failure of the system is a common cause of cabin decompression and possible nitrogen evolu tion. 
In high altitude flights above FL 500, crewmembers are protected against DCS by prior denitrogenation and a pressure 
suit. If loss of cabin pressurization occurs and symptoms of DCS are not present, a descent must still be made immediately to a pressure altitude per technical guidance (unless a functioning pressure suit is worn).  
Recent research suggests that an increase in physical activity  at altitude (as well as after descent) tends to dislodge 
nitrogen bubbles from joints, increasing the risk that bubbles will travel to potentially dang erous locations within the 
body . Furthermore, if DCS does develop, any additional movement of the limb (in the case of the bends) may worsen the 
condition.  
The effect of exercise on bubble formation after return to ground level following an altitude exposur e remains unproven. 
Numerous anecdotal accounts, however, suggest that postflight exercise increases the probability of delayed DCS. Also, postflight exercise -induced injury may be confused with or mask DCS pain.  
Finally, if during physical activity, asymp tomatic bubbles caught in the lungs pass through to the arteries as cardiac 
output increases blood flow to the lungs, then very serious DCS symptoms may arise. For these reasons, persons exposed to high altitude should not  perform strenuous exercise for 12  hours after exposure.  
Age can be a factor. Before  the age of about 40 years, no correlation between age and DCS incidence is clearly 
demonstrated. However, after age 40 DCS incidence increases with increased age. Factors contributing to this effect might be an increased deposition of fat within connective tissues, and changes in capillary density and permeability. 
There are some indications that body composition plays a part in an increased risk for DCS.  An increase in body fat may 
increase the risk for DC S. 
There is controversy concerning the effects of repeated exposure, i.e., two or more altitude exposures in succession. It 
appears that exposures occurring in rapid succession within minutes or a few hours of a previous exposure increase the 
incidence of DCS during the subsequent exposure. This increase is presumably because some bubbles may remain from 
the previous exposure. Bubble growth is more likely under this condition. If the exposures occur on successive days, there may be no increase in the incidence of DCS, but the time to first appearance of symptoms is often decreased in the 
subsequent exposure.  
There is substantial evidence that dehydration increases the likelihood of DCS.  When a person is dehydrated, this 
decreases the amount of water not only  for the body, but the amount of water in the blood.  The blood then is slightly 
thicker and it will take more work for the blood to flow through the body.  This causes issues with moving the gases 
through the body to be effectively removed.  
Diving prior to flying with a  self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) vastly increases the incidence of 
DCS. Furthermore, the procedure decreases the minimum altitude at which DCS manifestations begin. This decrease 
allows the occurrence of DCS even during f light on aircraft equipped with excellent pressurization systems such as 
commercial airlines, whose cabin altitudes are 5,000 to 8,000 feet. Even helicopter flight or driving to altitudes only a 
few thousand feet above sea level have contributed to DCS aft er a SCUBA exposure.  
USAF  regulations forbid flight within 24 hours of a compressed air exposure (SCUBA diving) for all normal flying 
operations.

UNCLASSIFIED 32 
Prevention of DCS  
Adequate protection against DCS can be established by aircraft pressurization and or denitro genation.  
Most military aircraft are pressurized and maintain a cabin altitude below 10,000 feet. In addition, the operational ceiling 
of unpressurized aircraft is FL250. Maintaining aircraft pressurization and a FL250 ceiling significantly reduce the 
incidence of DCS. But remember, DCS can occur at lower altitudes.  
Denitrogenation (preoxygenation)  is very effective in decreasing your susceptibility to DCS. This method involves 
breathing 100 percent oxygen to eliminate nitrogen from the body. When 100 perce nt oxygen is breathed through a tightly 
fitted oxygen mask, no ambient nitrogen enters the lungs. This procedure eliminates the lung nitrogen partial pressure; nitrogen rapidly diffuses from the tissues to the blood then to the lungs and is exhaled. The am ount of nitrogen eliminated 
during denitrogenation is dependent upon time. Assuming that the body contains 1200cc of dissolved ni trogen at sea 
level, Figure 3 -11 shows the amount of nitrogen washed out by denitrogenation.  
 
Figure 3 -11 — Nitrogen Elimination Table  
Treatment of DCS  
Anytime an occupant of an aircraft appears to be experiencing the symptoms of DCS, 100 percent/max oxygen should 
be administered and the affected area immobilized as much as possible.  
1. A crewmember should administer 100 percent/ max oxygen to that individual.  
2. The pilot must descend as soon as practical and land at the nearest suitable installation where medical assistance can 
be obtained.  
3. Before the affected person may continue the flight, consult a flight surgeon or civilia n aeromedical examiner. (DCS 
may occur up to 12 hours after mission completion.)  
Several considerations should be remembered. If symptoms of DCS are recognized, landing is mandatory and treatment should be initiated. If all symptoms disappear prior to landing, or immediately thereafter, 100 percent oxygen therapy 
should be continued as a precaution. A flight surgeon must be notified. If symptoms still persist after l anding, 
compression therapy may  be administered at the nearest hyperbaric facility. Compress ion therapy results in reduction of 
the nitrogen bubble size and resolves the DCS.

Introduction 
Increased pressure in an aircraft cabin or cockpit is maintained by pumping pressurized, conditioned air into the cabin 
from the jet engine compressor or an aircraft -powered electronic compressor . Pressurization systems provide th e most 
effective method of protection from hostile high altitude environments by minimizing the hazards of decompression 
sickness (DCS), hypoxia and fatigue.   
Information  
Cabin Pressurization  
Pressurization  Schedules  
Conventional cabin pressurization syste ms (Figure 4 -1) use engine bleed air. Cabin pressure and ventilation can be 
controlled by varying the amount  of air forced into the cabin and adjusting the overflow.  
 
Aircraft Pressurization System Types  
Isobaric System  
Aircraft pressurization may be regu lated by maintaining a constant  cabin pressure (isobaric system) as aircraft altitude 
increases. With this type system, the pressure difference between cabin pressure and ambient pressure increases with altitude. An example is the C -17 aircraft which maint ains a pressure schedule slightly greater than ambient to 8,000 feet 
MSL and then maintains 8,000 feet MSL through its certified ceiling.

UNCLASSIFIED 38 
Isobaric -Differential System  
A more common type of pressurization system is the isobaric- differen tial system, used on single or dual  aircraft. With 
this system, the aircraft is unpressurized until a preset cabin pressure is reached. Once reached, the isobaric function of 
the system maintains a constant pressure within the cabin until a selected pressure differential (cabi n pressure versus 
ambient pressure) is attained. Thereafter, as the aircraft climbs, the system maintains the designated pressure differential between cabin pressure and ambient pressure. With an isobaric- differential system, the cabin altitude varies with  flight 
altitude; although at a reduced rate (it is not linear).  
The T -6 is equipped with an isobaric differential pressurization system (Figure 4 -2). As the aircraft approaches 8,000 
feet pressure altitude, the control valve regulator will open and close the control valve to maintain cockpit pressure.  An 
8,000 foot cockpit altitude is maintained until a pressure differential pressure of 3.6  ±0.2 psi is reached at 18,069 feet.  
This differential is maintained from 18,069 feet to 31,000 feet, where maximum co ckpit pressure altitude is 16,600 feet.  
 
Figure 4-2 — T- 6A Pressurization Schedule  
For fighter/attack aircraft,  pressurization systems are set at a lower pressure differential, typically 5.0 psi. This safeguard 
is provided because of the smaller cabin volume and the increased danger of decompression during combat operations. Most of these aircraft do not employ pressurization until 8,000 feet MSL. Above this level, the cockpit remains at 8,000 feet pressure altitude until FL230. Thereafter, the system maintains a pressure differential of 5.0 psi . If this aircraft is 
flying at an altitude of FL400 (and assuming normal pressurization system operation), the cabin pressure will be 7.72 psi  
(5.0 psi plus 2.72 psi). On an atmospheric pressure table, 7.72 psi  will indicate an approximate cabin altitude of 17,000 
feet. 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Pressurization Systems  
There are advantages and disadvantages to having a pressurization system.  Listed below are the advantages and the 
disadvantages.  
Aircraft pressurization provides the following advantages : 
1. Reduced probability of DCS  
2. Reduced possibility of hypoxia  
Note  — The primary  purpose for aircraft pressurization is to reduce the possibility of DCS and hypoxia.  
3. Reduced need for supplemental oxygen equip ment below 10,000 feet cabin altitude. However, crewmembers are 
required to wear oxygen equipment during certain situations. For example, all crewmembers must wear oxygen equipment during emergencies involving loss of pressurization or emergencies involving the presence of fire, smoke,  or 
fumes.  
4. Reduced expansion of gastrointestinal trapped gas  
5. Controls cabin temperature, humidity, and ventilation within a desired comfort range  
6. Allows the crew and passengers to move freely within large cabins unenc umbered by oxygen equipment  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 39 
7. Minimizes fatigue and discomfort of crew and passengers during long flights (air evacuation, troop transport, etc.).  
8. Protects the sinuses and middle ears from sudden pressure increases during descents by slowly scheduling the cabin 
descent  
Aircraft pressurization has the following disadvantages : 
1. Decompression. The primary, and most critical, disadvantage of aircraft pressurization is the potential for 
decompression. If decompression should occur, the aircraft occupants are immediately exposed to the inherent hazards 
of high altitude  — hypoxia, DCS, trapped gas problems and hypothermia. Decompression will be discussed in greater 
detail later in this lesson.  
2. Increased aircraft weight because of the additional fuselage st rength required  
3. Requires additional design engineering, mechanical systems, and engine power  
4. Decreased performance and payload  
5. Increased maintenance requirements and costs  
6. Requires control of cabin air contamination from smoke, fumes, carbon mo noxide, carbon dioxide, water vapor and 
odors  
Types of Decompression  
There are three different types of decompressions.  There are explosive, rapid, and slow. The effects of a decompression 
are primarily due to the rate of pressure change and the pressure d ifferential.  
Explosive decompression is the quickest with a occurring in less than a half of a second (0.5).  This could occur as quickly 
as two -tenths of a second (0.2).  Even though there is very little difference between rapid and explosive decompression,  
explosive decompression is important to cover because it decompresses the lungs, which could damage them.  This usually 
occurs in smaller high flying aircraft, although not very common, and very little you can do except immediately get on 
oxygen.  
Rapid dec ompression is slower than explosive (0.5 –  15 seconds) and easily recognized therefore, you must consider its 
physiological effects. Air expanding in the lungs may cause physical injury and unrestrained crewmembers may be forced through an opening in the c abin. Because time of useful consciousness (TUC) is reduced after an RD, oxygen is the most 
immediate requirement.  
A slow decompression  is potentially the most dangerous type of decompression because it can be so slow that you may 
not even notice. If unawa re of the decompression, hypoxia may occur and you could be incapacitated (check cabin altitude 
periodically to detect a slow decompression). Slow decompression can occur when a leak develops from a failing pressure 
seal. Other physiological consequences t hat can result after decompression include DCS . A pressurizatio n loss requires 
descent to or below  10,000 feet.  
Factors Affecting Decompressions  
Several factors affect the speed at which cabin pressure will drop to ambient pressure. The larger the cabin vo lume, the 
slower the decompression, assuming other factors remain the same. The larger the opening in the cabin, the faster the 
decompression.  
The initial difference between the cabin pressure and the ambient pressure determines the rate and severity of th e 
decompression. The larger the pressure differential , the more severe the decompression.  
The pressure ratio , defined as the ratio between cabin pressure and ambient pressure, determines the time required for 
decompression. The larger the ratio, the longer  it takes for the two pressures to equalize.  
The physiological consequences after a rapid decompression are influenced by the ambient altitude at which the 
decompression occurs, particularly the effects and onset of acute hypoxia. The most severe effects are produced by a 
decompression involving a large pressure change over a short period of time (moving from a relatively low cabin altitude 
to an extremely high ambient altitude in the shortest amount of time). There is little effect if a large pressure chan ge 
occurs over a long period of time, or if a small pressure change occurs quickly.

UNCLASSIFIED 40 
Physical Indications of a Rapid Decompression  
The altitude chamber RD profile is intende d to train you to recognize the physical characteristics of an actual rapid 
decompre ssion. RDs in the chamber prepare you for recognition and action if an RD occurs in the aircraft.  
Explosive Noise  — When two different air masses collide, they cause a noise ranging from a swoosh  to an explosive 
sound.  
Windblast/Flying Debris  — The rapid evacuation of air during an RD is strong enough to blow unsecured items out of 
the aircraft. These could  include m aps, charts, flight logs,  etc. Dust and dirt will also kick up and interfere with vision for 
a short period of time. Even unrestrained passengers and crewmembers have been forced from aircraft by this tremendous 
movement of air. Therefore, you should always have your lap belts fastened during pressurized flight.  
Fogging — During an RD, cockpit temperature,  and pressure are reduced. As a result, there is a reduction in water 
saturation capacity and the water vapor not held in suspension appears in the compartment as fog. The dissipation of the fog is fairly rapid in fight er aircraft, but considerably slower in multi -place aircraft. The dissipation rate is affected by 
the volume of the aircraft cabin.  
Temperature — Cabin temperature during flight is generally maintained at a comfortable level; however, the ambient 
temperatu re decreases with altitude. If a decompression occurs, cabin temperature drops rapidly, possibly as low as  
-55 °C. Chilling and frostbite may occur if protective clothing is not worn.  
Pressure — A rapid drop in pressure occurs during an RD. The earlier you  recognize the physical characteristics of a 
decompression, the sooner you can combat the physiological hazards.

Introduction 
Sight is your most valuable sensory system in the flying environment. Depth perception, visual acuity, night vision,  and 
color vision are used to gather data from inside and outside the aircraft. However, poss essing these attributes does not 
mean the eyes will be used effectively. A crewmember with average visual capabilities, using a proper scanning technique 
has an advantage over the crewmember with superior vision who doesn’t know how to “see.” 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 44 
There are als o distinct physiological and perceptual limitations on the sense of vision in this environment. The human 
body is designed to move at roughly three miles per hour. Therefore, your sense of vision is designed to acquire, process, 
and react to information at  that speed. However, aircraft can travel faster than the speed of sound, so you’re at a 
disadvantage because of your limited visual and perceptual processes.  
As part of this lesson, you will receive a demonstration using a night vision trainer.  
Information 
Anatomy and Function of the Eye 
 
Figure 5 -1 — Anatomy of the Eye  
Figure 5 -1 shows a cross section of the eyes as viewed from above, with the major structures labeled. The cornea and 
lens refract (bend) light and focus it on the retina in a manner simila r to the lens of a camera. Photoreceptors in the retina 
are stimulated and messages are sent to the brain, via the optic nerve, where the process of perception takes place.  
The Retina  
The retina is the innermost layer of tissue of the eye, containing millions of photoreceptors (rods and cones) allowing you to “see” an image. The rods and cones are distributed over the entire retina, except where the optic nerve and blood 
vessels exit the eyeball. This sight is the optic disk or anatomical  blind spot.  
Optic Disk  
The optic disk is considered an anatomical blind spot since there are no photoreceptors located here. However, the optic disks are located in different locations in each eye (Figure 5- 1). Therefore, when the eyes are being used simultaneously, 
called binocular vision, the nerve impulses from the retinas provide the brain with an image negating the effects of the 
blind spots. The blind spot will only be noticed when an object is being viewed with one eye, monocular vision. This situation can occur when one eye is obstructed by a canopy rail or bow, oxygen mask , or even your nose . 
Does this phenomena mean you notice a blank area in your field of vision? Unfortunately, the answer is “no. ” The brain 
does an interesting thing when one of the blind spots is “ active.” It “fills in” the missing visual information caused by the 
blind spot with surrounding visual information. This process is hazardous if you are scanning for other aircraft and there 
is an obstruction in your field of view exposing one of the blind  spots. Figure 5 -2 illustrates how the optic disk/anatomical 
blind spot works.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 45 
The Fovea 
Next to each optic disk is the fovea, another area of the retina with a specialized function. It is a tiny pit containing onl y 
cones and the natural point on the reti na where the lens focuses an image. Your best color vision and maximum visual 
acuity are in the fovea. Also, the fovea of each eye (like the optic disk) is offset to help a person have stereoscop ic depth 
perception to roughly 600 feet . 
Because of the lack of rods at this site, the fovea is responsible for a second type of blind spot occurring during night 
vision.  
Photoreceptors  
The retina consists of two classes of photo sensitive cells: rods and cones  and various interconnecting nerves.  
Cones are the photor eceptors allowing you to see the details of the world in color under bright light conditions. They are 
densest in the center of the retina and decrease in number toward the periphery.  
There are three cones types: 1) those sensitive to short (blue), 2) medi um (green), and 3) long (red) wavelengths.  
However, the “mixing” or interpretation of colors occurs in the brain, not the retina.  
Cones require high light levels to function. Low light and night vision characteristics are discussed later in the lesson.  
Rods are the photoreceptors densest at the periphery of the retina and decreasing in number as the center of the retina is 
approached. They allow you to see in gray tones under conditions of dim light and provide for our peripheral vision. 
Anything interfering with rod function interferes with your ability to see at night.  
Rods are 10,000 times more sensitive to light than cones. Their sensitivity is due to a highly photoreactive protein called 
rhodopsi n (visual purple).  There is only one rod type, which is se nsitive to a range of wavelengths in the middle of the 
cone sensitivities.  
We’re all a little blind. That’s right, you may pass eye tests without a blink, have 20 -20 vision, even see in the dark, 
but you could still miss seeing a jumbo jet at a mile and a half if the conditions  are right. There’s a blind spot in 
your eye about 30 degrees right of center when you’re looking straight ahead. Your peripheral vision from the eye 
compensates for this “defect” because your brain normally combines the pictures from both eyes.  
When the peripheral vision from one eye is obstructed, the brain can’t fill in the missing part of the picture. 
That’s really not a problem when you’re walking around on the ground. But when you get inside of a machine  — 
British racing machine, American flying machi ne, etc.  — and look outside, things start getting in the way, like 
passengers, copilots, or windshield posts.  
“Big deal,” you say, “All I have to do is move my head.” Maybe so, but try this test. Hold the picture below at 
arm’s length and focus both eyes o n the cross on the left windshield. Now, move the picture toward your face, you 
should be able to see the C -5 all the way in. Okay? Try it again with your left eye closed. The Galaxy will disappear 
and then reappear as you draw the picture closer. Ask your self: How much airspace will my aircraft cover during

The two classes combine to give the human visual system a tremendous operating illumination range from very bright 
(photopic) to very dim (scotopic) conditions.  
Types of Vision  (Pho topic, Scotopic , and Mesopic)  
Photopic (day time) vision  is used in daylight or artificial illumination with sufficient light to activate the cones. Colors 
are easily discerned and images are sharp.  
Cone/color (daytime) vision  
Best acuity and  reaction time s 
Scotopic (night time) vision  is used during low -light conditions. Cone cells are ineffective, resulting in poor resolution 
of detail. Color vision is lost and visual acuity decreases as much as 20/200.  
Rod (night) vision 
Blind spot  
Poor acuity, no color vision  
Mesopic (dawn and dusk) vision  is used when light availability is between adequate and inadequate. The transition 
zone between scotopic and photopic vision is called mesopic vision. Here both rods and cones are active, although not at 
peak efficienc y. Mesopic vision may be of great importance to aviators, because a low level of light is present at dawn 
and dusk, as well as during night operations. Under dark conditions ( moonlight intensity), cones cease to function and 
rods alone are responsible for vision (scotopic vision).  
Scotopic vision is characterized by poor visual acuity and a lack of color discrimination, but it greatly enhances sensitivit y 
to light. Rods can function in dim light equivalent to an overcast night with no moonlight. The dimmest  light cones can 
function is roughly equivalent to a night with 50% of a full moonlight. Another way to think of this: a white light barely 
seen by the rod system under scotopic conditions must increase in brightness 1,000 times to be visible to the cone s ystem.  
Light conditions during dawn, dusk, or full moon levels create these scenarios. Visual acuity and color discrimination 
diminish as light levels decrease and cone cells become less effective.  One may incorrectly assume he or she is seeing

Characteristics of Vision  
The Visual Field  
Vision can be divi ded into anatomical and functional systems. The total visual field is approximately 15 0°, depending on 
the individual. The center 30 ° is considered central vision. Of this central vision, the very center 3° is used for focal 
vision or high acuity. The rema ining visual field is used for peripheral vision.

Figure 5 -3 — The Total Visual Field  
Focal vision is processed at a higher level of consciousness and 
peripheral vision is processed at a more subconscious level. 
Additionally, each type of vision can be categorized by the primary functions they perform. F igure 5-3 illustrates the visual field and the 
regions of overlap.  
Focal vision is c oncentrated  on the fovea, constituting 3° of the total 
visual field . Its primary function is to recognize and identify objects, 
generally to answer the “what is it” questio n. Therefore, perceiving 
information with focal vision is a conscious process requiring active attention by the observer.  
Focal vision orients a perceived object in space relative to the observer. It also provides maximum visual acuity and depth perception . Visual acuity decreases markedly as the image is focused 
away from the fovea (Figure 5 -4). For example, if you have 20/20 
vision and observe an object ten degrees off the fovea, your visual acuity drops to 20/100. Focal vision also requires high illumina tion 
levels because the fovea consists solely of cone cells. As a result, you don’t have the same visual acuity during night or low -light operations 
as during the day.  
Peripheral vision is used primarily to orient oneself relative to the environment and co nstitutes the remainder of the 
visual field. Unlike focal vision, it does not require active attention on your part to process information and serves to orient you to your environment. The majority of the photoreceptors used in peripheral vision are rods. As a result, one of the main characteristics of peripheral vision is very poor visual acuity.  
There is also little color vision with peripheral vision because of the decreased number of cone cells in the periphery of the retina. However, the rods used in p eripheral vision allow you to see at night.  
Sensing and identifying objects with peripheral vision is difficult. Peripheral vision is largely used to detect motion (real  
or illusory) and positional information. Orientation cues provided by the peripheral v isual field are extremely powerful. 
These cues are processed subconsciously and are extremely difficult to overcome. An example of the power of the visual system to orient the body is the reaction people have in wide screen movie theaters where the scene on the screen is of an aircraft flying through a canyon, with its twists and turns. The audience tends to lean in the same direction the aircraft  
banks in order to keep themselves perpendicular to the visual horizon.  
It is important to add that a  combinatio n of these two types of vision is used at light intensities equivalent to dusk or 
dawn. Under these conditions the level of light is slightly below that needed for efficient cone vision and too intense for efficient rod vision. Thus, both types of sensors are operating simultaneously. Beware, since at these levels central (fovea)

acuity, although functional, is only about one -half as good as in average daylight conditions and rod vision is also 
deficient.  
You will fly any time of the day. Understanding the different ways your eyes work in differing light conditions helps you 
understand your abilities and limitations in both daylight and night flying environments.  
Day vision uses cones as photoreceptors due to the high light intensity. These cells adapt quick ly to increases in light and 
give the crewmember the ability to use focal vision for detail and still maintain peripheral cues for orientation. Rods are used to some degree in the periphery but tend to become desensitized or “washed -out” in high intensity light 
environments.  
Distance and Depth Perception  
Binocular Vision  
Due to the physical separation of the eyes, each view s the environment  from  a slightly different perspective. Due to 
retinal disparity, e ach eye sees a slightly different picture of the wor ld and as a result, the b rain compares images from 
both eyes to integrate into a single picture of a 3D world  though stereo psis. 
Stereo psis is the mechanism for judging distanc es of objects within about 200 meters (Davis  et al. , p. 150). The 
effectiveness of stereo vision falls off rapidly as the viewing distance increases; the specific upper limit of distance for 
binocular cues is not well established (Gibb , p. 80). But, it is important to note these distance limits are for stationary 
objects. When an obje ct is moving (or the observer is moving), the distance between the two eyes’ images changes and 
it has been shown in numerous studies that the rate of this change can be used to estimate time to collision and direction 
of travel (Gibb , p. 81). 
Oher binocul ar functions are:  
Convergence: Inward movement of  eyes to focus on a near object  
Accommodation: Ability to adjust the strength (shape) of lens (required to focus both near & far objects on retina)  
As a result, the overall process is termed binocular vision , as it requires the use of both eyes, and binocular cues refer to 
the mechanisms by which aircrew assess depth and distance.  Binocular cues are assessed subconsciously and allow for 
very precise distance estimation, but only at relatively short distances.  
Monocular Vision  
Monocular vision is when input from only one eye sent to brain for interpretation. Monocular depth perception is learned 
over time, we become familiar with the sizes and shapes of objects in our environment. Humans have also learned to us e 
monocular depth cues to determine an approximate depth such as:  
Motion parallax  
Objects at varying distances “move” in different directions & at different speeds  
Near objects move faster  
Linear perspective  
Parallel lines “converge”  
Illumination perspective  
Shadows, lighting, etc. affect perception of objects  
Aerial perspective  
Blue or hazy objects appear more distant  
We are then able to take these learned lessons and apply them to our activities. For example, there are plenty of people 
who live with very poor depth perception, but the cues they learn throughout life allow them to successfully drive 
vehicles.  Among other things, they have learned that when driving along a road, nearer objects appear to be moving faster 
than distant objects. The same such information is used to help us determine how far away objects are when they are 
beyond the useful range of binocular depth perception (approximately 600 feet).

Common Physiological Limitations and Threats  
Physiological limitations involve visual contrast  of objects against their backgrounds, shapes of targets, movement of 
targets and environmental conditions.  
Visual Contrast h elps the eye acquire the target. Objects are sensed by the differences between light and dark. Therefore, 
the greater the contrast of a target against its background, the easier it is to detect. For example, an aircraft painted a dark 
color silhouetted against a hazy sky is much easier to see than an aircraft painted gray flying against the same hazy 
background. This example shows why cam ouflage can be so effective. Camouflage attempts to blend a target into its 
background while breaking up the visual outline. To illustrate this concept, look at the paint schemes of some F -18 and 
F-16 fighters. There are two shades of gray on the aircraft with lighter shades towards the outer edges of the aircraft. The 
effect is to make the aircraft appear smaller and, therefore, more distant by confusing the contrast of the aircraft against 
the sky.  
Shapes of Targets a lso affect the eyes’ ability to acquir e them. The larger, more angular the shape of the target, the 
easier it is to see and is sometimes referred to as its “visual cross section.” A good example is viewing an F -16 head -on 
versus viewing it from the side or top. It is much more difficult to see  the aircraft in the head -on view.  
Movement of a Target  against a background aids acquisition by the eye. A moving target is easier to detect than a 
stationary target. The degree of movement required also depends upon the background. An aircraft flying aga inst a 
broken, irregular background, like a partly cloudy sky, requires less apparent movement to be detected than when it is flying against a featureless background, like a clear sky. As a result, a target’s motion must be ten times faster in a clear  
sky than in a broken, cloudy sky to be perceived.  
Environmental Influences on Vision vary based on type. An example of this is the effect of hypoxia on vision. This 
effect is based on altitude and duratio n of exposure to that altitude. With increased oxygen st arvation, the extremities 
become less responsive and flying becomes less coordinated. As hypoxia worsens, the field of vision begins to narrow, 
and instrument interpretation can become difficult.  
Obviously, cloudy conditions restrict visibility but clear c onditions can also cause problems such as glare. Glare  is a 
significant problem, especially at high altitudes. With regard to glare, the human eye only performs optimally over a very narrow range of illumination, the light source can scatter within the eye  onto the retina.  
For example, if you’re flying at FL350 with a solid cloud deck below, you’ll experience significant reflected glare (similar 
to being on a snow field on a sunny day). To help decrease the effects of glare, crewmembers are issued sunglasses and 
have visors on their helmets.  
Sunglasses reduce the amount of light entering the eye, decreasing your visual acuity. The more light sunglasses 
eliminate, the worse the visual acuity. Military issued aircrew sunglasses eliminate 85 percent of the ligh t entering the 
eye and reduce visual acuity to an average of 20/30. Commercially available sunglasses may reduce visual acuity to 20/60 or 20/65 because of the amount of light filtered out. The lenses of the sunglasses should be made of glass or polycarbon ate 
to filter ultraviolet radiation. Additionally, the lenses should not distort color (use green or gray lenses, or lenses certified  
not to distort color) and should not be polarized, distort shapes or blur distant objects. Use issued sunglasses or buy a quality pair of sunglasses meeting or exceeding USAF  requirements.  
External light sources that can produce glare:  
Sunlight, fires, flares, explosions, camera flash  
Reflected light off snow or water  
Daylight (setting sun), night (city lights)  
Optics:  High C ontrast Visors,  Glasses, Visor, Windscreen , etc.  
Night time Condit ions 
In terms of human biology, night work is a crime against nature. We cannot see well in the dark.  The battlefields of prior 
generations saw action most often during periods of daylight wh en visual acuity was best. Indeed, vision was a limiting 
factor concerning the most effective time to launch an assault. Only the most important covert missions would be carried out at night, when the element of surprise was best facilitated by darkness an d suboptimal enemy performance could be 
anticipated in response. However, while enemy performance was degraded as a result of poor vision, the offensive force could expect a comparable reduction in its own performance due to this same limitation. Today, technology has advanced 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 50 
to such a degree that human visual limitations have been significantly mitigated. Nighttime battlefield operations are now 
carried out regularly and with much greater success (HAOP, 6.1.1. 1., 2016).  
Empty -Field Myopia  is caused by the tendency of the eyes to focus at approximately 3 meters in front of the face. This 
phenomena occurs if the eyes have nothing to focus on at infinity. You face this problem during high to medium altitude flight where there may be a featureless background o r indistinct horizon. The hazards of empty -space myopia are caused 
by an inability to see targets outside the 3 meter focal range. Therefore, be aware of empty -space myopia and focus on a 
distant object (like the horizon or an object on the ground) to brin g the eyes’ focus out to infinity before looking for 
traffic.  
Visual Illusions  
The visual perception of something existing objectively but misinterpreted is a visual illusion. In a study by Bell and Chunn (1964), spatial disorientation and visual restrictions were the psychological factors responsible for approximately 23% of the aircraft accidents they investigated . Visual illusions and reduced vision may cause judgment errors that cannot 
be compensated for by corrective actions.  Visual illusions are a for m of spatial disorientation; you mentally perceive an 
image different than the image seen by the eye. Visual illusions can be caused by a variety of physical and 
physiological/perceptual factors.  
Physical Factors  
Physical factors affecting daytime visual i llusions include weather, terrain, lighting,  and sun angles.  These factors can 
lead to multitude of perceptual problems. For example, the horizon is used by the peripheral visual field as a cue for 
orientation and balance. However, when a perceived horizon  is not parallel to the earth’s surface, you may still believe it 
is the correct horizon. Therefore, you can become disoriented and experience a false sense of orientation if you do not 
have a reliable visual horizon. This illusion is extremely important in conditions of marginal visibility, where the true horizon is obscured or not visible. In these cases, the eyes tend to use any straight line as a horizon.  
Peripheral vision can compound the problems 
encountered in daytime visual illusions because it does  
not require conscious attention. So, in order to compensate for illusions caused by false horizons, you 
must use conscious thought to override the 
subconscious input. Doing so is difficult since it 
requires you to use your focal vision for orientation 
information, forcing you to further divide your 
attention between monitoring the aircraft and keeping it in the correct attitude. If you are unable to 
concentrate on your instruments, the subconscious 
input from your peripheral vision causes you to orient 
yourself to the false horizon. For example, flying over 
a sloping cloud layer where the earth’s surface is not visible, you will tend to orient the aircraft so it is 
parallel to the cloud deck. To regain orientation, you 
must focus on the aircraft’s artifici al horizon (provided 
you were aware of the unusual aircraft attitude). 
However, if you look outside again, the horizon provided by the sloping cloud deck can cause you to reorient the aircraft parallel to the perceived horizon created by the 
cloud deck. Fi gure 5 -5 illustrates  this problem.  
In hazy or foggy weather, indistinct horizons can also be confusing. Critical visual cues required to safely fly approaches 
and landings may be missing. The decreased visibility of the runway changes your linear perspecti ve. As a result, you 
may descend too early (duck -under) in order to keep more of the runway in sight, or you may shift your aim point to a 
visible part of the runway and land short. You may fly an approach and have adequate visual cues during the approach.  
But, after entering a shallow ground fog during landing, you may suddenly find these cues significantly reduced or 
unavailable. The fog or haze eliminates the peripheral horizon and confuses the cues you use to judge distance and depth 
perception. Additio nally, fog or haze diffuses lights, making them appear dim and causing you to think you are farther 
away from an object than you really are.  
Sun angle and shadows also create problems. Shadows caused by low sun angles or from the time of day can mask 
hazar dous terrain features, particularly in the low altitude environment. This illusion is important because more and more

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 51 
aircraft fly low altitude missions. For example, during  a low -level mission, with the s un low on the horizon, you may see 
a mountain in fr ont of you but fail to see a hill in front of the mountain because of shadows.  
Sun angle and lighting of terrain can also confuse your perception of altitude during low -level flight. For example, flying 
a low -level mission over hilly terrain may cause a mi sperception of altitudes. The misperception can be caused by 
shadows and differing contrasts due to different sun angles. This situation is particularly dangerous if you are used to 
flying over terrain during a specific time of day and then fly the same ro ute at a different time, with different sun angles.  
Different types o f terrain can also cau se visual miscues and illusions. Flat, featureless terrain like valley floors, deserts 
or the ocean lack distinct features allowing you to visually determine your al titude above the ground. If these factors are 
combined with a hazy horizon, you have the larger problem of visually determining altitude and  attitude. In these 
situations, a slight descent is visually imperceptible; the aircraft can impact the ground befor e you realize the danger.  
Terrain around airfields can contribute to miscues and false perceptions of altitude during approach to landing. An airfield situated at an end of a valley with slowly rising terrain at the approach end of the runway can cause you  to land your 
aircraft long. As you approach the airfield, you fly over the terrain and visually perceive you are lower than you should 
be. As a result, you may climb above the correct glideslope to compensate for your perceived low altitude. Conversely, 
flying an approach over terrain sloping away from the approach end of the runway may cause you to descend below the 
ideal flightpath to compensate for the illusion of being too high. The desired and compensated flightpaths for both rising 
terrain and terrai n sloping away from the runway are shown in Figure 5 -6. 
 
Figure 5 -6 — Runway Approach Terrain 
Perceptual Factors  
The processing and perception of visual cues (factors) by the brain is affected by a variety of variables. These variables 
may include experience and expectancy, fatigue and other self -imposed stresse s. 
Experience and expectancy are major factors in visual illusions especially if you are fatigued or there are insufficient physical visual cues. Common examples of experience and expectancy problems are landing illusions caused by different runway widths and lengths. For example, if you are used to landing at your home field with a runway 300 feet wide and 
13,000 feet long, you will develop a series of mental pictures of the runway at different stages of the approach. However, 
should you fly to another bas e and encounter a runway with a different width and length than your home base, you run 
the risk of landing short or long.  
See Figure 5 -7 for the following example. Your home base runway is 300 feet wide and 13,000 feet long (runway A). 
Consider flying int o a field with a runway only 150 feet wide and 9,000 feet long (runway B). On a normal glidepath to 
runway B, the narrower and shorter runway appears to be farther away. You may perceive you are too high on your 
glideslope. Therefore, you could descend bel ow the correct glideslope in order to make the visual image of runway B 
match your mental picture of what runway A should look like. As a result, you could land short of the runway. Conversely, 
landing at a base with a wider and longer runway (runway C) than your home field may give the perception you are lower and closer to the runway than you really are. Therefore, you may slow your descent and fly above the required glideslope 
in order to make the landing runway look like your preconceived mental picture . Flaring too high is a common problem 
in this situation.  
 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 52 
 
Figure 5 -7 — Runway Width and Length  
Unless you have experience flying approaches and landing on runways shorter or longer than what you are accustomed 
to, you may use your mental picture of what  a runway is supposed to look like and adjust your visual picture to match. 
These illusions are increased by fatigue, when your ability to consciously prioritize information is slower and you 
subconsciously rely on your experience to provide cues.  
Midair C ollision Avoidance  (MACA)  
Another critical aspect of vision is its role in midair collision avoidance (MACA) . The Federal Aviation Administration’s 
“see and avoid” principle is founded on the crewmembers’ ability to maintain visual separation from other ai rcraft.  
The speed of jet aircraft, increased air traffic density and the amount of information processed during critical phases of 
flight requires good vision and alertness on your part to effectively apply the “see and avoid” principle. Now that we 
have s een the importance of MACA and the “see and avoid” principle, l et’s take a look at the primary threats associated 
with trying to employ the “see and avoid” principle. Those threats are perception and reaction.  
Perception and Reaction  
Reaction time is a measure of how quickly an organism can 
respond to a particular stimulus (Marieb, 2003).  Perception 
and reaction t ime has been widely studied, as its practical 
implications may be of great consequence. A s seen in a host of 
aviation mishaps , perception -reactio n time limitation can have 
grave consequences.  
Approximate perception and reaction time should be taken into 
account in the consideration of all types of sensory perception.  
This is especially true pertaining to aviation where a moment 
of inattention or a habit of poor attention management can 
cause the loss of a combat asset, or even worse, the loss of life.  
It should be noted that there is no data suggesting an exact 
human reaction time as it varies based on cue time, frequency, 
distance, fatigue and aler tness conditions, as well as reaction 
and perception ability. However, Benson & Strughold (196 9) 
suggests it takes approximately 6 .1 seconds for an average 
aviator to make a decisi on with a resultant motor input (Figure 5- 8). 
The times change for a variety  of reasons, including type of aircraft, physical and physiological state of the crewmembers, 
mental state of the crewmembers, time of day and weather conditions. Certain physiological and physical variables are under your control, including most self -impo sed stresses. For example, fatigue can directly affect your ability to detect 
another aircraft, perceive its position in relation to your aircraft and decide how to react. However, you can minimize 
fatigue’s effect by ensuring proper crew rest.

Reaction Time

Early Visua l Acq uisition and Scanning Technique  
So, with regard to MACA early visual acquisition of another aircraft is critical due to the aforementioned physiological 
limitations.  First, beca use of the geometry , you lose motion as a cue to acquire the other aircraf t with your peripheral 
vision  while in mid -air. When a collision occurs, the other aircraft has little or no apparent motion on the windshield. 
Therefore, you must acquire the target aircraft with your focal vision, which is a small portion of your total v isual field. 
Second, depending on the size and aspect angle of the target aircraft, the physical ability to visually acquire an aircraft i s 
also limited. For example, attempting to visually acquire a large transport aircraft, traveling in the same directio n but on 
a converging course, is much easier than spotting a small, private aircraft (like a Cessna 150) on a head -on collision 
course. Therefore, in order for you to visually acquire another aircraft in -flight, the target must be in your focal field of 
vision so it is focused on the fovea. Getting the target aircraft focused on the fovea is accomplished by using an 
appropriate scanning technique.  
Performing  a proper scanning technique  significantly 
decreases the chance of a mid-air collision . Maximum 
scanning effectiveness is achieved by a series of short  and 
controlled , regularly- spaced eye fixations  (movements) . A 
common scanning tech nique is to take an area of sky and 
divide it into sectors (Figure 5 -9). Look in each sector, then 
scan into the next by u sing a “Z” pattern or a “Diamond” or 
Off-Center pattern at night (5 -10). In order to see a target, the 
target must fall on the fovea long enough for it to be perceived. So, let your eyes stop, focus in a sector, then 
continue your scan.
 
During flight, you must continually scan in addition to performing other flight duties. Therefore, all crewmembers 
are vital keys in the “see and avoid” environment. 
Crewmembers knowing how to correctly scan for aircraft are 
invaluable assets, especially in high density traf fic areas. 
Ultimately, aircrew should try to find threats, clear all turns,  
listen for and adhere to all radio calls.  
What areas of the fl ight are higher risk for mid -air collision ? 
Usually, lower altitudes have higher density traffic and 
therefore a high er ri sk. The majority of near mid -air 
collision s in the United States occur below 12,500 feet MSL. 
Most military flights are at greater risk during the takeoff, 
landing and low -level phases of flight over land. During 
departures, you are busy establishing the aircraft on the 
departure path, receiving clearances from air traffic 
controllers, running checklists and navigating, in addition to 
flying the aircraft. You must also actively scan for other 
aircraft that may conflict with your flightpath. During the  
landing (terminal) phase of flights, you must fly the 
approach, monitor aircraft position, run approach and 
landing checklists, talk on the radios, and scan for other 
aircraft. Additionally, during terminal phases of flight you 
are more likely to be fatig ued, dehydrated, and possibly 
hypoglycemic. These factors degrad e your 
perception/reaction time. Similar threats occur in the low -
level environment.  
In the low -level environment, aircraft travel faster than during terminal phases of flight and are at low a ltitude for longer 
periods of time. Consequently, your time to react is lowered by the increased aircraft speed and your exp osure to the 
threat of a mid -air collision  increases because of the increased time spent in a low -level environment. Like terminal 
phases of flight, low -level flights are also task intensive, detracting from your ability to scan. Additionally, many low -
level altitudes are below air traffic control radar coverage. As a result, you lose air traffic radar as an aid to MACA.  
Figure 5 -9 — Scanning Technique  
 
Figure 5 -10 — Diamond  (Off- Center) Scanning  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 54 
Therefore, be especially alert to MACs in addition to terrain clearance and mission accomplishment. During these critical 
phases of flight, it is vital that you remain keenly aware of your responsibilities and limitations.  
A second mid -air threat results not from other aircraft, but from birds. The majority of birdstrikes occur below 2,000 feet 
AGL. Unfortunately, birds are more difficult to see than aircraft and they tend to fly just beneath or just above cloud layers. So as you fly out of the clouds on final approach, don’t be surprised if you must avoid birds while looking for the 
runway.  
Another more subtle limitation (tending to in crease perception time/ reaction time) is expectancy. Once you are notified 
of conflicting traffic, and especially if you are given the typ e of conflicting aircraft, you form a mental picture of your 
target. Unfortunately, your mental picture may not accurately reflect what you should really be seeing. For instance, your 
mental picture of what a C -130 looks like at 3 miles may not be accurate , leading you to misjudge your time to react.  
Because of the physiological and perceptual limitations to detecting other aircraft in -flight, it’s critically important that 
all aviators know how to correctly scan. The more crewmembers knowing how to correct ly scan for aircraft means there 
is a greater chance of detecting  and avoiding possible mid -air threats . 
Physiology of Night Vision  
Night vision uses different photoreceptive cells than those used during the day. Therefore, the physiological 
characteristic s of night vision and the factors affecting it are different.  
As previously mentioned, there are two types of sensory receptors in the retina: rods and cones. The rods are responsible 
for vision under very dim illuminations (scotopic vision) and the cones for higher illuminations (photopic vision). 
Remember, cones enable color perception. This is commonly known as the “duplicity theory of vision,” in that the 
presence of rods and cones enables the human eye to function over an impressively wide range of lig hting conditions. A 
common misconception is that the rods function only at night (dark conditions) and the cones function only during the day (light conditions). Actually, both rods and cones function over a wide range of light intensities, and at intermed iate 
illumination level s they function simultaneously.  
As discussed earlier, rods and cones are not uniformly distributed through the retina.  Cones are concentrated primarily 
in the center of the retina, while rods are primarily parafoveal and absent in th e foveal (macula).  There are 20 times more 
rods than cones in the retina (approximately 100 million).  Normal high resolution visual acuity is a result of the densely 
packed and centrally located cones.  Therefore, under photopic conditions, the cones are fu nctioning as intended and 
visual acuity is optimized in the fovea.  As lighting condition reduces to mesopic, visual acuity is reduced in relation to 
the reduced cone function.  
Under scotopic (night) conditions, cones cease to function, and, correspondingly, visual acuity is poorest.  Further, under 
scotopic lighting, the central area of vision (cone vision) becomes a central area of no -vision (the physiologic night blind 
spot).  
Physiologic Night Blind Spot  
The night blind spot is a second blind spot in the e yes, since the cones in the fovea require high light levels to function. 
Normally, you reflexively focus an object on the fovea in order to identify it. At night, however, there may not be enough 
light emanating or being reflected from a target to stimulat e the cones in the fovea. If this is the case, the target is not 
seen if it is focused on the fovea. Therefore, the fovea is usually not useful in identifying targets at night. In order to 
avoid this problem, learn to focus a target about 10 to 15 degrees off the fovea so it falls on an area of the retina that 
contains a greater concentration of rods (night vision scanning technique). It takes conscious effort to move the focused 
image of the target off the fovea by placing the object of interest on the den sest rod distribution , enabling  rod vision to 
overcome the physiological blind spot.  The “diamond scanning ” technique involves looking above, below, and to each 
side of an object in a diamond- shaped scanning pattern to keep the dimly lit object from bleach ing out and disappearing.  
Dark Adap tation 
The rods’ ability to function in low -light environments is high but their adaptability to low -light levels is fairly slow. For 
example, when you walk into a dark room or building after being in the bright sunlight,  a certain amount of time elapses 
before the eyes adapt and see images. Remember, rods are unable to distinguish color and are found primarily in the 
periphery of the retina. Because of their location, night vision is in the peripheral visual field and dep th perception and 
visual acuity are severely degraded. Since night vision depends on the use of rod cells, your focal vision will be 
diminished, so expect to rely more on your  peripheral vision than you normally would . 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 55 
Both rods and cones undergo a chemica l change when exposed to light that initiates visual impulses in the retina.  The 
retinal photopigments regenerate to continue light detection.  Under dark adaptation, the retinal photopigment cells 
become fully regenerated, and retinal sensitivity is at its  maximum.  Rods and cones differ in their rate of dark  adaptation.  
Rods require 20 – 30 minutes (or longer) in absolute darkness t o attain maximal sensitivity. Cones reach maximum 
sensitivity in about 5 –  7 min utes. 
Nighttime Visual Illusions  
The rods’ extr eme sensitivity to changes in blood oxygen levels causes certain physiological factors to affect night visual 
acuity. For example, an increase in cabin altitude decreases night visual acuity. Carbon monoxide (smoke and fumes or 
tobacco smoke) also decreases visual acuity at night.  
Aviators must be aware of how changes in altitude and oxygen levels affect visual acuity. As a result, certain factors (physical and perceptual) can increase aircrew vulnerability to night time visual illusions.  While flying at ni ght, you may 
want to consider breathing 100 percent oxygen to improve your vision.  
Nighttime visual illusions are similar to daytime illusions in that they are caused by a loss or confusion of a visual horizo n 
and can cause problems in all phases of flight . The following section discusses illusions caused by false horizons and 
lack of a horizon, the perceptual mistakes made by crewmembers and what you can do to correct and avoid these mistakes.  
Black Hole Illusion  
The black hole illusion is produced during night landing, when there are no visual references except runway lights. The situation may worsen when the lights of a city near the end of the runway make the approach appear high (no distinct 
horizon). To make the perception match expectation, the pilot lowers the aircraft and lands short. A similar situation is 
produced by blowing snow or sand and also when the runway and nearby terrain are covered by fresh snow or sand.  
If a pilot makes a visual approach at night into an area of low cultural lighting an d does not use glide slope guidance, 
inevitably, the pilot will fly the approach below the normal approach angle and often find himself quite a bit short of the 
threshold or overrun. This fact has been repeatedly demonstrated to be true, yet the exact reas on is not well understood. 
Some have attributed it to a visual angle seen by the pilot that causes the pilot to maintain the visual angle, resulting in 
an “undershoot.” Others have shown how the lack of cultural lighting causes the pilot to inadvertently d escend prior to 
safe minimum altitudes. Regardless of the reason, pilots should know that if they make a black hole approach and do not use glide path assistance, such  as VASI or precision approach path indicator ( PAPI ), they will land short of the runway.  
One solution to the black hole effect is to fly published instrument approaches, preferably an approach providing 
glidepath information. If a visual approach is chosen, the approach should be backed up with an instrument approach or 
a published approach profile to prevent a descent below a safe altitude.  
Autokinesis — Means “self -motion.” This illusion occurs by staring at a single light source against a dark background. 
Autokinesis can occur by fixating on a star, stationary ground lights at night, or lig hts from other aircraft. After staring 
at the light for a few moments, it appears to move randomly. The cause of the illusion is not definitely known. Generally, the larger and brighter the object, the less the autokinetic effect.  
Autokinesis can be hazard ous. Pilots fixating on stars or ground lights have mistaken these objects for other aircraft, 
sometimes taking evasive action. Also, when intercepting or following a relatively stable aircraft, it may appear to move 
erratically. Making unnecessary control  inputs based on an incorrect perception can be tiring at best or hazardous at 
worst. To prevent autokinesis, do not stare at the light. Use the night scanning technique and shift your gaze frequently to avoid prolonged fixation on a target. Always monitor  your flight instruments to help prevent or resolve any perceptual 
conflicts.  
Indistinct/False Horizons —  At night can be caused by any series of lights in a linear formation. For example, an aircrew 
flying in a rural area of the country may see a series o f street lights and perceive them as the horizon. In a case occurring 
over the ocean, a student pilot flying a night mission saw a line of fishing boats stretched out below and misperceived 
them as the horizon. Fortunately, the instructor pilot noticed the  aircraft was in about 15 degrees of bank and corrected.  
Another cause of false horizons occurs when flying toward land after a mission over the ocean or a large body of water. If you are flying toward a populated area of land with scattered lights, the tr ue horizon with stars will tend to blend with 
the scattered ground lights. This visual picture may confuse you and cause you to use the water -land boundary as the 
horizon.  
The best preventive measure to decrease or eliminate the problem of false horizons i s to ensure a good instrument cross -
check.

UNCLASSIFIED 56 
Lack of Horizon — If you are flying at night over featureless unpopulated terrain or the ocean, you may not see a visible 
horizon. This environment can cause you to use a false horizon (if one becomes available) o r rely on your vestibular 
system (discussed in the Spatial Disorientation lesson) for orientation information.  
Weather Effects at Night  
Nighttime visual illusions can be caused by the same types of weather that cause daytime visual illusions. Shallow groun d 
fog, rain, snow and haze all affect your visual ability to discern altitude, attitude and distance. At night, however, there 
are some distinct differences in how these environmental factors affect you.  
Haze and ground f og tend to decrease your forward an d slant range visibility just as they do during the daytime. At night, 
haze and ground fog tend to cause runway lights to be dimmer than usual and makes them appear farther away than they actually are. Additionally, bright flashing lights, like sequenced f lashing lights found in some airfield lighting systems, 
can disorient you at night in foggy or hazy weather. The brightness of the flashers reflected in the weather may give you 
a false sense that the aircraft is nose low in relation to the horizon. You ma y also believe you are closer to the light source 
than you actually are because of the apparent size of the light. The lights appear larger because of the diffusing and 
scattering of the light by the fog or haze.  
Rain and s now can cause light from aircraft  landing lights to be reflected back into the cockpit. As a result, you may 
sense an overwhelming visual sensation of the aircraft pitching up or down. This sensation is caused by the high speed 
of the illuminated rain drops or snowflakes passing by the wi ndshield. If rain or snow is encountered, in addition to 
lowered visibility, your ability to transition to visual flight for landing may be impaired. Deviations from the desired flightpath may occur. Therefore, keep the aircraft in a position to make a saf e landing.  
Visual System Improvement Measures  
You can use a number of different techniques to maximize visual acuity in the cockpit at night. Ensure the windshield 
and your helmet visors are clean and scratch free. If the mission involves formation flying or visually intensive work, but 
does not allow for an increase in cockpit lighting levels, consider breathing 100 percent oxygen. Additionally, you can keep the cockpit lights low to allow for maximum dark adaptation. Finally, be aware that weather , expect ancy and fatigue 
degrad es perception/reaction time, leaving less room for error.  
Overcoming Illusions  
Education  
Training  
Thorough preflight  
Use all available NAV aids  
Visual Approach Slope Indicator ( VASI ) 
Velocity Vector/flight path markers  
VVI, altimeter  
Increase crosscheck frequency  
Note  — The problem of night visual illusions increases because you are flying at times that are usually out of alignment 
with your normal sleep -wake cycles and you tend to be fatigued. The problem also increases when travelin g across time 
zones. Therefore, self -imposed stresses play a significant role in nighttime visual illusions.  
Laser Awareness  
In Los Angeles , on November 2009, a  Southern California man who aimed a laser beam at two airliners as they 
approached an airport w as sentenced to 2½ years in federal prison for disrupting the flights (Associated Press, 2009). The 
U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles says Dana Christian Welch of Orange was the first person in the U.S. to be convicted at trial of interfering with pilo ts by aiming lasers at their planes. Authorities say the 37 -year-old aimed a 
handheld laser at two Boeing jets as the passenger planes were about to land at John Wayne Airport on the night of May 
21, 2008. The laser beam struck one pilot in the eye, causin g “flash blindness,” and interfered with pilots’ ability to land 
the other plane.  
A U.S. News and World Report article from June 2014, revealed the following facts: There were fewer than 300 reports 
of aircraft being targeted by lasers during 2005. By 2013, that number had risen to nearly 4, 000 (Soergel, 2014) . In 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 57 
response to this alarming trend, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) instituted a targeted program to combat lasing 
of aircraft near major airports around the country. The program offered re wards of up to $10,000 for information leading 
to the arrest of individuals using lasers to illumi nate aircraft (FBI National Press , 2014). The FBI credited this program 
with the recent sentencing of a Clovis California man to 14 years in prison for repeat edly lasing two helicopters with an 
extremely powerful handheld laser. As of December 2013, the FBI has confirmed at least 141 arrests, 107 cases forwarded 
for prosecution, and 84 convictions related to aircraft lasing incidents (Soergel, 2014).  
These scen arios demonstrate not only the alarming rise in the number of aircraft/laser interactions, but they also underline 
the seriousness with which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the FBI treat these incidents. Civilian and 
law enforcement pilots a re now being targeted by individuals using handheld lasers in an attempt to disrupt operations, 
or possibly “just for fun.” Military pilots flying in civilian airspace are experiencing similar encounters with lasers. In 
addition, military pilots must also be prepared for lasers used on the battlefield. These lasers may be used for targeting 
in an attempt to damage the aircraft or weapons payload, or as “dazzle lasers” intended to disrupt or degrade flight 
operations. Lasers are currently used as defensive m easures by the US military, and they have even been posited as 
offensive weapons . 
As far as we can tell, all laser exposure incidents that occurred during flight have been due to Low Energy lasers. Despite being called Low Energy, they are capable of blind ing a person at tactically significant ranges (greater than  5 miles). Our 
discussion will focus on low energy lasers. However, high energy devices are an emerging technology and a policy 
concern in terms of laser weapons . 
No matter what the intent of the laser/aircraft interaction, flight crews need to understand the threat various types of lasers 
pose to ensure not only mission effectiveness but crew/aircraft survival.  
Laser Basics  
The word “Laser” is an acronym for Light Amplification by the Sti mulated Em ission of Radiation.  Just as there  are 
unique terms in the kinetic weapons environment, there are unique terms in the laser world.  
Collimation  
Lasers produce light that does n’t spread out in all directions or diverge like normal white light sources. Becaus e the laser 
beam stays together , it passes through space very efficiently in a collimated beam. Collimation or directionality refers to 
how straight the beam propagates without spreading. To put things into perspective,  a flashlight has some collimation 
while an incandescent light bulb  has none.  Laser pointers, collimated beams of light,  can be used like a flashlight to find 
and identify targets.  
Monochromatic  
Generally, lasers are a single color; one wavelength or a very narrow band.  The wavelength that a  laser emits  is a key 
factor in analyzing the hazards and physical properties of the laser.  There is an inverse relationship between wavelength 
and frequency.  Shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies while longer wavelengths have lower frequencies.  Highe r 
frequencies are associated with higher energy.  As a rule of thumb, if all other parameters of a given laser are equal, a 
shorter wavelength will have higher energy and will be more dangerous to human tissue.  
Biological Effects  of Lasers on the Eye  
What m akes lasers so dangerous  to the human eye ? Lasers can be hundreds of times “brighter” than the sun , and high 
intensity can be projected over long distances . Also, light can be sharply focused by the eye.  The energy of the light is 
transferred to the retina . If the energy is high enough, the retina can be burned resulting in permanent damage.  The portion 
of the retina that is most sensitive to detail and color discrimination is the fovea and of greatest concern because it is th e 
area where color vision and v isual acuity occur.  
Lasers are especially dangerous at night when the pupil is fully dilated and there is a greater risk of a damaging laser 
beam entering the eye. The wavelength or color of light emitted from a laser also has a very important role in determining 
the hazard potential of a laser beam. A green laser is in the heart of the visible spectrum where it receives the maximum 
magnification when passing through the cornea of the eye. The cornea and lens combination of the human eye has the 
capability to focus light by a factor of 100,000 (Sliney and Wolbarsht, 1980). This means that a relatively small amount 
of laser light can have very damaging effects on the retina.  
Laser damage potential for flight crews can be characterized by the following terms:  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 58 
Dazzle  
Imagine you are driving home, heading west into the setting sun, and your pitted windshield is almost impossible to see 
through.  
Glar e Blindness or Flash Blindness  
Imagine you have momentarily looked at the sun, or possibly Uncle Bill used the flash on his camera right in your face. 
You will see spots that gradually fade away, but for several seconds or even tens of seconds your vision is impaired.  
Retinal Burns  
At this point you have a permanent blind spot. The laser has impacted the retina with suf ficient energy and time on target 
to overwhelm the retina’s capacity to wick away the heat, and the tissue is now burned. You have a scar. If the scar is off 
axis you will likely suffer no lasting perceptible effects because the brain is very good at averaging out small errors. If the burn is on the fovea or optic nerve, the news is not so good. Most minor retinal burns heal over time and the individual 
can still function normally.  
Laser beams can impact a pilot very differently depending on the distance fr om the laser source to the pilot. These types 
of lasers can be purchased on -line for less than $200 and cause distraction hazards at approximately 11 miles!  
When optical radiation is absorbed, the action on the absorbing biological tissue is either photoch emical or thermal.  In 
the ultraviolet region, the action is primarily photochemical.  In the infrared region, the action is primarily thermal.  In the 
visible region, both effects are present.  When the intensity of the radiation is sufficiently high, the eff ects are of such a 
magnitude that damage to the absorbing tissue will result.  
The damage from optical radiation may range from relatively mild, from which there is complete recovery, to severe, 
where there is little, if any, recovery.   
The location of the exposure within the eye determines the degree of incapacitation from a retinal injury of a given degree 
of severity.  The fovea (the central two degrees of the visual mechanism) is the region of the retina, which is most sensitive 
to detail.  The rest of the  retina, the fovea to the peripheral retina, is increasingly more sensitive to the light as one moves 
away from the fovea.  However, these parts of the retina are not as sensitive to detail.  Therefore, an injury to the fovea 
can severely reduce visual funct ioning in terms of resolution.  An injury to the peripheral retina is less incapacitating in 
the same terms.  
A laser lesion in the peripheral areas of the retina may not be noticed or cause a significant reduction in visual functionin g 
(i.e., visual acuity)  because the vision in those areas is very poor compared to vision in the fovea.  Lesions in areas other 
than the fovea are referred to as “off axis” damage or hits.  Most are benign.  
Laser Eye Protection  
A laser threat is defined as any laser light that cou ld alter operations without causing catastrophic structural damage to 
platforms. With that definition in mind, even relatively low power hand held devices can pose a risk to aircraft during 
low level flight operations or during take -off or landing. Landing  is the most vulnerable portion of any flight profile and 
gives the aircrew the fewest options. Laser eye protection (LEP) may be the most beneficial during this portion of the 
flight. Wavelength and optical density (OD) are the two most critical factors in determining what LEP should be used in 
a particular laser threat environment. Most LEP devices are developed and manufactured for a specified set of 
wavelengths so they are considered wavelength specific.  
Optical density is a measure of the amount of lig ht transmitted by a filter, such as eye protection spectacles. This term is 
defined such that high OD equates to low transmission of light. The OD is critical because it specifies how much of a certain wavelength’s energy is blocked (reduced), thus the deg ree of protection. The OD, or protection factor of the LEP, 
is designed to bring the energy level to below the maximum permissible exposure. The range from the laser, the 
magnification of optics being used, and the energy density of the laser are used to calculate OD for unique situations. 
The scale is logarithmic such that an OD of 0 equates to 100% transmission and a reduction factor of 1, an OD of 1 
equates to 10% transmission and a reduction factor of 10, an OD of 2 equates to 1% transmission and a redu ction factor 
of 100, etc. Sunglasses have an OD of about 1.  
LEP choices will usually be a balance between protection from incident laser beams and visible light transmission allowing the aircrew to still see cockpit displays and the airspace around them. M any LEP devices resemble dark glasses 
with various degrees of wrap around for added protection.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 59 
The current spate of green laser pointer incidents is especially troubling because it is more difficult to protect aircrew 
from these lasers while still allowin g aircrew members to have full access to cockpit displays. Many cockpit instruments 
use green in their displays, so blocking green light with LEPs can make it difficult to see all of the information displayed on cockpit instrumentation. Very narrow band LE Ps are available; however, they are expensive and their protection can 
be of limited value for off -axis laser exposure.  
LEP comes in many formats and styles, such as spectacles, goggles and wrap around. They also come in single band and multi -band waveleng ths. There are also different types of filter technologies commonly used in LEP. Absorptive filters 
are one of the most popular types. Absorptive filters are dye -based and made of polycarbonate material. These LEP are 
designed to absorb particular bands of  wavelengths by adjusting the concentration of dyes to protect from a band or bands 
of wavelengths.  
Procedures after Exposure  
If you detect the laser energy (remember it may be IR and undetectable by the unaided eye), look away immediately and use whatever  shielding action you can reasonably take and still maintain aircraft control.  You may need to transfer all 
visual references to your flight instruments to prevent f urther exposure and maintain aircraft  control.  This is especially 
important at night when the pupil dilates and is capable of allowing more light energy in to be focused on the retina.  
Report the laser you detected or suspected to other flight members both within your aircraft as well as to those in the 
same airspace so they can avoid exposure/confirm detection.  Report the laser to any controlling agencies (traffic, ground, 
etc.) as well so they can re- direct other aircraft in flight to avoid the area/be aware of the threat.  
Upon landing, report immediately to the flight surgeon who will perform a laser -injury specific exam and treatment if 
injury is detected.  The flight surgeon will also have you fill out a detailed report on the specifics of the incident which 
will help in their evaluation of potential injury as well as aid in your report to Intel, the SOF, squadron supervision, and 
aircraft maintenance.  
Using the acronym LASER for the reporting details will help flush out the required items needed to enable a thorough investigation.  
Location of the source:  GPS coordinates/direction of beam/terra in characteristics/building descriptions  
Appearance:  Color and brightness can help w ith determining the wavelength, power estimates , and the potential type 
of laser used . 
Scanning or tracking:  Did the laser ap pear to be tracking your flight path or was it m oving about as if trying to find 
something to lock onto ? 
Effects:  Any symptoms experienced such as pain, stinging, tearing, popping sounds in the eyes, dazzle effects with 
or without symptoms, sensor interruption, red -out of visual field, flash blindness  
Regularity:  Pulsed/flashing or continuous beam effect  
Summary  
Vision is the primary means to collect information about your environment and your position in it. It can be viewed as a two-part system, the physical visual imaging part and the mental perceptual part. The cones on the retina of the eye are 
responsible for the ability to see color and operate most efficiently in bright light. They are scattered throughout the retina 
(with the greatest concentration in the fovea) and primarily used in focal vision ; the area of greatest visual acuity.  
Rods are found outside the fovea and in the peripheral areas of the retina. They are roughly 10,000 times more sensitive 
to light than cones and give you the ability to see in a low -light level environment. Rods perceive only black and white, 
allowing for distinction between shades of gray. They are the photoreceptors used in peripheral vision.  
The retina contains two blind spots, the anatomical blind spot formed by the optic disk and the night blind spot caused 
by the concentration of cones in the fovea.  
You must incorporate an effective scanning technique in order to see an object. The scanning technique involves taking 
the visual field and dividing it into sectors. Search each sector, then let your eyes stop and focus  before moving on 
because an image is not perceived unless it is focused on the retina. This scanning technique may be used during the day 
or night. However, the night scan must make allowances for the night blind spot by focusing the image 10° to 15° off the 
fovea.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 60 
Vision and visual perception are affected by self -imposed stresses, such as fatigue, weather conditions, physiological 
conditions (hypoxia), and expectancy (what the eyes see is not necessarily what the mind expects to see). Be aware of 
these pr oblems and be prepared to counteract them if they occur.  
To maintain the high level of alertness required, ensure you are well -rested, fed, and hydrated and have thoroughly 
planned and briefed your mission. Be aware of the visual illusions you could encoun ter on your mission and how you 
can deal with them. And lastly, know your threats to include lasers and how to prepare for and how to combat laser 
exposure threats.

Introduction 
Situational Awareness (SA) is a primary concern because loss of SA is either the primary factor or a contributing factor 
in most human performance related mishaps. As a result, SA and SA theory has gained great interest in both civilian and 
military aviation communities. Subsequently, a number of definitions, theoretical models,  and methodical approaches for 
the assessment of SA have been developed over the years in an effort to truly understand and improve SA (Salas and 
Dietz, 20 11). For instance, Tolk and Keether (1982) state, “SA is the ability to envision the current and future disposition 
of both red and blue aircraft and  surface threats.” Endsley (2000 ) submits, “SA is t he perception of the elements in the 
environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their status in 
the near future .” Whitaker and Klein (1988) suppose, “SA is the pilot’s knowledge about his surroundings in light of his 
mission’s goals.” Finally, the Air  Force definition in Air Force Instruction 11 -290 states, “In flying, this refers to an 
aircrew’s continuous perception of self and aircraft in relation to the dynamic environment of flight, threats, and mission, and the ability to forecast, then execute, tasks based upon that perception.  
Regardless of the varying SA definitions, the end state is the same: aviator awareness of what did happen, what is 
happening, and what could happen next. SA is the key element in most USAF aviation undergraduate, graduate,  and 
continuing education courses. For example, Air Force Instruction 11 -290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management  states, 
“A desired end state of CRM training is a high state of situational awareness.” Simply stated, great SA is critical to the maximization o f USAF combat capabilities and the preservation of its combat assets.  
This lesson covers SA theory, its associated attention management threats, and the predominant causes of loss of 
situational awareness (LSA). The lesson also covers recommended tools to prevent LSA and recovery techniques when 
encountered in flight. After completing this lesson, you will know the fundamentals of AMT and SA, comprehend LSA 
causes, and finally, k now how to recognize, prevent, and treat loss of SA in a flight environment.

Introduction to Situational Awareness  
From the earliest cockpits fitted with rudimentary gauges, to 5th generation airframes wired for helmet -mounted displays; 
the impetus for developing a philosophy rooted to situational awar eness has always bee n grounded i n the human’s 
capacity to process environmental cues. As previously mentioned, the concepts encompassing the term SA are broad, but 
the reader may benefit by the following USAF Aerospace and Operational Physiology definition as the starting point in 
the understanding of SA:  “The accurate  perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, 
the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their status in the near future” (Handbook of Aerospace and 
Operational P hysiology , Chapter 4.5, page 4 -88, 2016).  
SA theory supposes that SA is only good if a person has an accurate perception of his or her environment and its cues.  
Perception itself is the receipt of sensory information followed by conscious attention directed to the information for analysis.  Yet, this analysis does not mean situational awareness, it only means perception.  
Situational awareness applied, is the result of the processing and the integration of informational cues received through 
the human being’s  many sensory systems (Figure 7 -1). M ost information comes from the v isual system. This is usually 
the most reliable information for awareness and orientation. The problem is when visual information is unreliable, it can take you by surprise, just because you are so used to rely ing on visual information. The auditory  system is the least 
reliable. The vestibular s ystem is the source of our “sense of balance,” and can be tested by walking with our eyes closed. 
Without a vestibular system this simple feat would be virtually impossible. In traditional flying, almost anything done in 
an aircraft exceeds the design specifications of the vestibular system.  
Seat-of-the-pants is the phrase used to describe an additi onal sensory system called the somatos ensory system.  This 
system is essentially a collection of sensors throughout the body that gives information on muscle tension, joint position, 
and pressures on skin and deep tissue. At ground level, this system can give you a sense of your in -range (within touch 
or rea ch) environment. The risk here is that it is difficult to ascertain who or what is touching you without cueing 
information from another source (i.e. visual or auditory cues). In flight, the vestibular s ystem gives you a constant sense 
of where the G vector  is. The problem is, in an aircraft, G is not always the same as down. Finally, the auditory s ystem 
also provides awareness and orientation information. While it doesn’t give a lot of information, what it does give can be 
useful and life -saving (i.e. gear and flap movement or the sound of thunder).  
 
Figure 7 -1 — Applied Situational Awareness  
Over time, these cues provide aircrew with not only a sense of location in the environment, but also a sense of their place 
or role in occurring events. This is accomplished by effectively processing critical info rmation using one of two types of 
information processing mechanisms; the conscious or subconscious processors.

Primary  Types of Processing Mechanisms  
Conscious  
The conscious  part of our minds is considered a serial processor. This is the level at which we actively process 
information; we are at our best when we do one thing at a time (serially). The conscious level is aware of its existence 
and the existence of other things and situations. It’s also the seat of situational awareness. The conscious level is much 
slower than the subconscious level but much less prone to illusion and habit pattern interference. Learning to fly begins at the conscious level and is slowly transferred to the subconscious level as flying skills develop. The same can be said 
with dr iving, riding a bike, or even reading.  
Subconscious  
The subconscious  part of our minds is considered a parallel processor. This level is capable of doing more than one thing 
at a time and can do them very quickly. Habit patterns, memory, and skills are kep t in the subconscious. You can ride a 
bicycle, drive a car, or fly an airplane at the subconscious level of attention, but conscious attention must be used to oversee what the subconscious is doing. This oversight ensures the validity of information being used by the subconscious 
and the appropriateness of its actions.  
Both the conscious and the subconscious processors work in tandem and operate predominantly on cue familiarity and/or 
level of stim uli. Cue familiarity is the human’s ability to recognize fac ts, hints, verbiage, voice tone and voice pitch, 
information, warnings, or other environmental clues.  
Information Processing Loop   
When a set of cues is repeated or recurring, the human brain 
commits it to memory (the sub conscious) in an effort to exert 
less energy and waste less time. This memorized information is 
stored in the brain and when the same or similar cues present 
themselves again, instantaneous memory rehearsal prompts the 
subconscious to dominate the processing loop leading to an action or ex ecution.  
Memory driven action can provide aircrew with major benefits during time -critical scenarios (e.g. Boldface). However, this 
process also omits 50 percent of the processing loop which 
includes forecasting and prediction based on training and 
experience, and evaluation of the resultant outcome based on risk-assessment and priority. Subconscious processing utilizes 
the inner -ring only, which is depicted in Figure 7- 2. 
Memory -based (subconscious) decisions are largely responsible 
for mistakes which ofte n lead to the loss of life or the loss of combat assets. Aviation examples are gear -up landings, 
failure to complete checklist items, and switch or input errors. More common errors are missing a commonly used exit 
during the commute home, misreading a comm only read passage or script, and even misjudging the steps leading to the 
second level of your home.  
As seen by the outer ring, conscious decisions have further to travel, yet, it conservatively completes all areas of the 
processing loop. The distance trav eled during the conscious processing ring typically requires approximately 5.0  – 5.5 
seconds and leads to a well thought -out and appropriately assessed action or execution. Unfortunately, the flight 
environment is inherently capricious and does not always afford aviators the time needed to make a conscious decision. 
Therefore, having a healthy balance of memorized (current) data, rehearsed emergency procedures, in -flight emergency 
scenarios, and technical knowledge provide aviators the ability to maximize t he pros of both types of processing 
mechanisms.  
Primary Components of SA  
According to the HAOP (2016 ), the context of SA can be further divided into components (or areas) of geographical SA , 
spatial/temporal SA , system SA , environmental SA , and tactical SA ; each subarea identifies the conditions and dynamic 
flow of activities within a period of time. Prevec and Ercoline (2004) further divide these SA components as follows:   
Figure 7 -2 — Information (Cue) Processing Loop  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 68 
1. Geographical SA  
Geographical SA includes knowledge of the location of one’s own ai rcraft, other aircraft, terrain features, airports, 
cities, waypoints, navigation, fixes and position relative to designated features, runway and taxi assignments, and 
climb and descent points. It is critical to understand that a loss of Geographical SA ca n precipitate a loss of 
Spatial/Temporal SA and in many cases may even lead to spatial disorientation (SD). Spatial disorientation is a subset of SA related to the flying environment and will be discussed later in this course.  
2. Spatial/Temporal SA  
Spatia l/Temporal SA includes, but is not limited to, knowledge of the aircraft’s altitude, attitude, heading, velocity, 
vertical velocity, G -loading, flightpath, aircraft capabilities, projected flightpath, and project landing time. Although 
similar in nature, b oth Geographical and Spatial/Temporal SA differ in that Geographical SA is in relation to 
topography while Spatial/Temporal SA is in relation to the earth.  
3. System SA  
System SA includes system status, functioning and settings, radio settings, altimeter a nd transponder equipment, 
flight modes and automation settings, impact of malfunctions and system degradation, fuel, time, and distance available of fuel.  
4. Environmental SA  
Environmental SA includes knowledge of weather formations, temperature, icing, ce ilings, clouds, fog, sun, 
availability, visibility, turbulence, winds, microbursts, instrument flight rules ( IFR) vs. visual flight rules ( VFR ) 
conditions, areas and altitudes to avoid, projected weather conditions.  
5. Tactical SA  
Tactical SA includes iden tification, tactical status, type, capabilities, targeting, threat prioritization, location and 
flight dynamics of other aircraft, aircraft detections, launch capabilities, imminence and assignments, current and 
projected threats intentions, firing and man euvering, mission timing and status.  
Levels of Awareness  
A person may correctly perceive their spatial and positional relationship to earth and may even perceive their position in 
relation to other aircraft, but may not perceive a serious system malfunctio n occurring in the aircraft because of a poor 
or improper crosscheck. As a result, they are not situationally aware. To be situationally aware, a person must: (1) sense 
various aspects of their environment, (2) attend to that information and perceive it, ( 3) integrate that information at an 
intellectual level, (4) produce an awareness of the situation at that instant, and (5) constantly update this awareness as a result of new sensory information.  
Situational awareness is dependent on one’s knowledge, infor mation availability, predictive capability and ability to 
direct attention to the right information at the right time, and the ability to integrate information into a current concept of the situation. Maintenance of situational awareness requires tremendou s coordination and timing capacity to direct the 
conscious to the appropriate information at the appropriate time and then be able to develop a concept of what is occurring. Making it even more difficult is the requirement to project the nature of the situation into the future and the 
requirement to conceive and execute actions based on that projection. There are a multitude of factors which can both 
positively and negatively affect these abilities. For example, forecasting and executing are based on one’s initial 
perception as well as their training, experience, and their ability to effectively manage stress during demanding scenarios.  
To perform a task, you must invest some level of attention to it, and depending on urgency and risk, certain levels of 
awar eness must be employed. SA theorist Micah Endsley ( Toward a Theory of Situational Awareness in Dynamic 
Systems , 1995) supposes there are three levels of awareness:  
Level 1: Perception (Basic)  
Level 2: Comprehension (Intermediate)  
Level 3: Prediction (Advan ced) 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 69 
Level 1: Perception (Basic)  
The first (basic) level of situational awareness is the raw cue received and 
processed by our sensory systems; most often referred to as perception 
(Figure 7 -3), but it’s important to note that the signal may be present 
without awareness if there is background noise  or inattention to a particular 
signal. This is the root cause of loss of SA; without signal identification 
you cannot move to the next level of awareness.  
Level 2: Comprehension (Intermediate)  
The second (inter mediate) level of situational awareness is based 
on the comprehension of the situation (Figure 7 -4). For instance, 
all of the sensory inputs processed in a given period of time are channeled to a central processing station for racking and stacking in terms  of priority. Once processed, the signals help to form a 
holistic view of the environment. If an environmental cue is not 
processed due to competing signals, then the picture may not be as 
clear and the level of SA is not fully formed at the comprehension 
level.  
Level 3: Prediction (Advanced)  
Once the comprehension of environmental cues is established, the next level of situational awareness (advanced) is projection  or a 
prediction of “what happens next?”  (Figure 7 -5). The link to this 
level of SA is achie ved through knowledge of the status and 
dynamics of the elements and comprehension of the situation. In 
other words, a combination of both level one and level two SA. 
The prediction of future actions is typically focused on the near 
term. The next few minutes of the mission relies upon advanced 
experience and judgment formed by technical knowledge of the system or situation.  
Processing SA Cues  
Presentation and processing of SA cues is critical to good SA. In the flight environment these cues are presented i n 
various ways, such as instrumentation clusters and gauges, clouds and other weather phenomena, warning tones and 
lights, among other engineering mechanisms such as the stick shaker. Though these cues often save lives and preserve 
combat assets, the human ’s ability to process those cues is limited to the four previously mentioned sensory mechanisms; 
visual (sight), vestibular (orientation), somatosensory (touch/feel), and auditory (hearing).  
Each of these mechanisms  is reliant on appropriate cue levels, ty pes, and frequencies to affect good SA. Some cues may 
not be strong enough, or are not delivered using the right method to illicit or drive a response from the aviator. Cues such as altitude warning horns may be loud; but if they are not the right tone and  pitch, a crewmember cannot effectively 
discriminate the warning horn from other loud noises. Another example is a nuisance warning light while flying in the pattern to an engine fire light during takeoff. A decision (aircraft input) must be made, and sometimes the decision is to do nothing.  
Predominant Causes of Loss of Situational Awareness (LSA)  
Perception  
When a crewmember is presented with too much, too little, or incorrect information, adequate information processing 
and reaction time must also be pro vided. Processing time is critical because humans’ ability to transform presented 
information into an accurate perception is highly dependent on how much time is available. Additionally, more time is 
required to convert that accurate perception into a phys ical action (or inactio n). Using our previous example , how long 
did it take the pilot to read and recognize the engine RPM gauge read zero? Additionally, how long before she directed 
the boom operator to check the circuit breaker? For humans, conscious per ception with resulting motor input doesn’t 
happen automatically, and this human factors limitation greatly affects the interaction between Liveware and the other four HSI components.

UNCLASSIFIED 70 
Perception is the acquisition and processing of sensory information which  guides a response based on those objects 
(Blake and Sekuler, 2006). According to Benson & Strughold (196 9), perception follows a definite chronological pattern. 
After a stimulus has been applied, a certain period elapses before the sensation is perceived;  the sensation then increases 
to a maximum, after which it begins to  fade. Hence, before the sensation becomes manifest, it is preceded by a latent 
phase. This span of time is the perceptual latent period ( Figure 7 -6), i.e., the period between the onset of  the stimulus and 
the onset of its perception.  
 
Figure 7 -6 — Perceptual Latent Period  
In early Air Force aviation, perceptual latency generated very little interest until the evolution of aircraft flight decks a nd 
cockpits. Advancements such as glass inst rumentation, heads -up/heads -down displays, helmet -mounted cueing systems, 
night vision devices, etc. highlighted the need to understand the amount of time needed for aviators to safely process key 
information, especially during critical phases of flight. P erception, decision, and reaction times are particularly important 
in remote aviation due to the inherent Information Technology (IT) latency associated with remote aviation.  
Reaction Time  
The perceptual latent period is also part of the reaction time, for ming its first or sensory part . Reaction time is a measure 
of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus (Marieb, 2003). Reaction time has been widely studied, 
as its practical implications may be of great consequence, e.g. a slower than normal reaction time while driving can have 
grave results.  
In an effort to mitigate the risks associated with perceptual latency and reaction time limitations, Blake and Sekuler (2006) suggest a concept termed Active Perception. Active Perception drives sa mpling behavior. When aviators sample 
their environments purposefully, they look (visual), listen (a uditory), touch  (proprioceptor), rather than waiting on cueing 
events to happen, ignoring cues and making no decision at all. Additionally, active perceptio n promotes temporal 
preparation; and j ust like event preparation reduces the number of response alternativ es, temporal preparation improv es 
perception and reaction time.  
Many factors have been shown to affect reaction times, including age, gender, physical  fitness, fatigue, distraction, 
alcohol, personality type, and whether the stimulus is auditory or visual. Perception and recognition scenarios vary based 
on phase of flight, time of day, crew or formation make -up, while perception and reaction time may vary based on a 
number of factors such as those listed in Figure 7 -7 — Perception and Reaction Time Factors.

Figure 7 -7 — Perception and Reaction Time Factors  
Mitigating Perception -Reaction Threats  
Aircrew can prepare for a given event by visualizing that event in advance.  For example, carefully considering the steps 
to take during an emergency procedure can give aircrew a perform ance benefit when that emergency occurs .  
According to Jennings, and Coles (1991), they distinguish two types of preparation: event preparation and temporal or 
time preparation. In the first ca se, one has advance information about the features of the upcoming stimulus or the 
associated response and hence, the response alternatives are reduced. In short, one knows what stimulus will be delivered 
and which response is required. In the second case,  one has advance information about the temporal moment of the 
upcoming stimulus, that is, one knows when the stimulus will be delivered.  
For an example of event preparation, assume a driver steering a car on a curvy road in the mountains. Various traffic 
signs announce whether the next curve is a leftward or a rightward curve. The driver can use this information to prepare 
the necessary steering movements, even though he might not yet be able to see the next curve.  
Rosenbaum (1980) developed the so -called p re-cuing procedure in which a pre- cue provides participants with advance 
information about the reaction time ( RT) response movement that has to be executed. He observed that advance 
knowledge about one or more parameters of the required response movement ( e.g., side, direction, or distance) decreased 
RT. Similarly, Osman et al. (1995) found that pre -cues reducing a four -alternative to a two -alternative choice task 
decreased reaction time and more specially, the motor part of reaction time.  
To sum up, when participants know in advance what kind of response is required by the target stimulus, they can prepare 
motor aspects of the response in advance and hence, respond faster. Everyday examples for temporal preparation can be 
found in various situations, for ex ample, in sport. Assume a drag car racer waiting to go . Before the light turns green and 
he can actually accelerate, the yellow light will appear. Or, assume a runner performing a 100 -meter sprint and listening 
to the shouting of “Ready, steady, go!” In both examples, the start signals, that is, the green light or the shouting of “go!” 
are announced by a warning signal, that is, the yellow light or the shouting of ‘steady .’ The driver and the runner can use 
these warning signals to anticipate, and thus prep are for, the occurrence of the start signals and hence initiate an earlier 
acceleration or start, respectively. Just like event preparation reduces the number of response alternatives, temporal 
preparation reduces the potential time points of stimul us pres entation and thus improv es reaction time.  
Attention Management Threats  
General Attention Management Threats  
Many major mishaps are due to lost situational awareness involving attention threats. Attention threats hamper or prevent 
proper situational awarene ss. They can occur when the conscious level of awareness is distracted, has too many tasks to 
manage, or fails to monitor the environment.  
Self-imposed stresses make attention threats more likely. Poor nutrition, fatigue, poor physical condition, and 
medic ations all have the tendency to affect your ability to allocate your attention appropriately. As a professional, it’s 
your responsibility to prepare yourself both physically and mentally for the challenges inherent in being a crewmember, 
including seeing t he flight surgeon when you don’t feel well.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 72 
According to the Air Force Safety Center t he most predominant 
attention management threats are captured in the Person -Level 
Factors  section and categorized under Physical and Mental 
State . The mental and physica l states of individuals are how 
people know, think, learn, understand, perceive, feel, hurt, 
guess, recognize, notice, want, wish, hope, decide, expect, 
remember, forget, imagine, and believe. There are four sub -
categories to Physical and Mental State:  
Physical Problem (PC300) is defined as medical and physical 
conditions that can result in unsafe situations.  
Substance Effects  
Physical Illness/Injury  
Fatigue  
Dehydration  
Body Size/Movement Limitations  
Physical Strength & Coordination  
Nutrition/Diet  
State of Mind (PC200)  is defined as  when an individual’s personality traits, psychosocial problems, psychological 
disorders, or inappropriate motivation creates an unsafe situation.  
Psychological Problem  Life Stressors      Personality Style  Overconfidence  
Pressing  Complacency     Motivation  Mentally Exhausted (Burnout)  
Sensory Misperception (PC500) are factors resulting in degraded sensory inputs (visual, auditory, or vestibular) that create a misperception of an object, threat, or situation.  
Motion Illusion is degra ded  Turning/Balance Illusion  Visual Illusion  
Misper ception of Changing Environment   Misinterpreted/Misread Instrument   Temporal/Time Distortion  
Misinterpretation of Auditory/Sound Cues   Spatial Disorientation   
Mental Awareness (PC100) is defined as factor s of an attention management or awareness failure that affects the 
perception or performance of individuals.  
Not Paying Attention (Inattention)  Fixation  Inaccurate Expectation  
Negative Habit Transfer  Distraction   Interference/Interruption  
Technical/Procedu ral Knowledge Not Retained   Task Over -Saturation/Task Under -Saturation  
Task Inattention  
Interestingly, the human body considers decision making a mundane task and quickly teaches itself to memorize tasks as to exert as little energy as possible. The physio logical truth is that human beings are lazy by nature, always searching for 
the most energy -conserving and quickest ways to accomplish tasks. This phenomenon is always present and is even more 
active after accomplishing the same task for extended periods o f time. In the cognitive arena, this is also known as the 
Boredom Effect or Boredom Proneness. Boredom Effect reflects that human performance is influenced by a lack of 
concentration or boredom when participating in an assignment that has too many tasks, o r if a single task is too lengthy 
or tedious.  
Preventing, Recognizing, and Recovering From LSA  
Tools for Improving Attention Management  
Attention management threats can be mitigated through mission preparation and an honest awareness (assessment) of 
your c urrent capabilities and limitations (both physical and mental). Additionally, a systematic evaluation of each 
crewmember’s proficiency and currency (e.g. , pre-step operational risk management ( ORM )), in conjunction with  
Figure 7 -8 — Tools for  AMT Improvement  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 73 
thorough preflight preparation (i.e. , effective mission pre- briefs and mission planning) will significantly reduce the 
likelihood of inattention errors. Also, mission or flight rehearsal (chair flying) allows for faster reaction time to events 
with less probability of error. This also reduce s the possibility of unanticipated events and uncerta inty. These actions 
(Figure 7 -8) can all help free- up attention allocation and reduce the risk of distraction, fixation, task saturation, or other 
technical errors that increase attention requirements. I n addition, building a mission plan based on your current abilities 
identify potential safety of flight issues thereby reducing the potential for a mishap.  
Tools for Preventing LSA  
SA can vary from day -to-day and from mission- to-mission, depending on facto rs such as your physical condition, 
experience, and mission complexity. Crewmembers should be vigilant of their own condition. There are many tools a 
crewmember can use to build and keep SA in flight such as these listed below:  
Constantly Assess Your Own P erformance (and of Others)  
Upon arriving at the aircraft, while reviewing the forms and conducting the preflight, analyze how discrepancies will affect the mission. Use risk management tools to determine if any aircraft factors will render the flight envir onment, or 
crew capabilities, unsafe. While in flight, planning for the next phase of flight is another tool for preventing LSA. If 
you’re not doing something or planning for the next phase of flight, there is an opportunity to lose situational awareness. 
Stay ahead of the aircraft and environment and always have a way out. The “I’M SAFE”  checklist is just one of many 
recommended strategies to assist aviators with self -assessment.  
The “I’M SAFE” Checklist  
Illness  — Are you currently suffering from any illness or recovering from a recent illness?  
Medication  — Avoid taking any medications while flying. All medications must be approved by the  flight 
surgeon.  
Stress — What is your stress level? Mental? Physical?  
Alcohol  — Are you still under the influence of alcohol, including its residual effects?  
Fatigue  — Do you currently feel fatigued or tired?  
Eating — Are you maintaining your hydration, and have you eaten a nourishing meal prior to the mission?  
Establish C ontracts during Mission Briefs /Discuss Broken Contracts during Post -Flight Debriefs  
Another tool for improving situational awareness is to establish pre -agreed actions and communications procedures 
during pre and post -flight briefings. This technique reduc es indecision due to sudden emergencies and other high intensity 
situations; this is especially useful during critical phases of flight such as departure and landing, gaining or losing  altitude , 
or a kinetic event. Parts of the contract might include brevi ty and communication expectations, emergency actions and 
techniques, and other pre -agreed crew expectations.  
Mission pre briefs, step briefs, or hand -over briefs, provide opportunities to increase awareness by asking “What if?” 
questions. Use these briefin gs to fill knowledge gaps and to acknowledge known threats and ensure mission objectives 
are clear and concise.  
Additionally, post -flight debriefs provide opportunities for the entire crew to discuss what happened and why. It also 
allows for techniques, ta ctics, and procedures to be shared amongst team members to further mitigate potential safety of 
flight issues. Oftentimes, discussing what did not happen, is just as important as discussing what did happen; especially 
as it pertains to broken contracts bet ween crewmembers, or other pertinent operators such as Air Traffic Control ( ATC ), 
Ground Forward Air Controller (GFAC )s, Flight -Leads, Mission Control Center ( MCC )s, etc. 
Minimize and Manage Interruptions  
Interruptions (e.g., due to ATC communications) and  distractions (e.g., due to a conversation among others on the flight 
deck) occur frequently during flight. Some cannot be avoided and therefore must be coped with by the flight crew. Others can be minimized or eliminated through training, adoption of effe ctive procedures, discipline and the use of good 
judgment. According to the skybrary website (2019), you should a void the most frequent causes of interruptions and 
distractions including: non -flight -related conversations, distractions by cabin crewmembers,  and non-flight -related radio 
calls. 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 74 
If the number of interruptions and distractions is not minimized or the impact of residual interruptions and distractions is 
not controlled, flight safety can be affected. In particular, when a flight crew is disturbed while monitoring or controlling 
the aircraft, errors can occur and go undetected (Skybrary, 2019).  
Delegate Tasks  
Whether flying in a two -ship low on fuel and having problems finding a tanker or carrier, or flying an RPA providing 
real-time intelligence to  ground forces, the delegation of tasks helps  ensure that all the bases are covered and the entire 
aircrew isn’t focused on just one aspect of the problem to the exclusion of all other activities. Delegation matrices can also be established as a part of th e mission pre -brief.  
Situational Awareness Recovery (SAR)  
After reductions in SA, a skilled operator must reassess the environment to rec over SA. Gartenberg et al. (2013 ) call this 
process Situation Awareness Recovery (SAR) and is defined as the process of  restoring SA when SA has been reduced. 
What do you do if you recognize lost SA? First, reassess and reprioritize in -flight tasks and then communicate.  
Prioritize Tasks  
In-flight tasks can be prioritized in the following three categories: 
1. Terrain clearance tasks  — Fly the aircraft . Get away from dirt, trees, and rocks; call “knock -it-off”; and reevaluate 
your situation.  
2. Mission critical tasks  — These tasks are essential for the successful completion of the mission.  
3. Noncritical tasks  — The completio n of these tasks makes no significant contribution to the mission. However, a 
noncritical task could become elevated to a higher level task if not attended to at the right time.  
Communicate  
Communication can go a long way in clearing an LSA episode. Talk t o other flight members, crewmembers, or other 
agencies to build SA.  
Declare an Emergency  
If needed, declare an emergency. Declaring an emergency has several positive effects for regaining SA. Doing so communicates with everyone involved and lets them know you have a problem and need help to r esolve it and gets 
immediate attention and priority of air traffic control. Declaring an emergency focuses your attention to the task at hand  
— flying the aircraft and landing safely.  
Recognizing LSA  
When aviators lose SA, it is be helpful for them to know  their own warning and/or red flag indications. Additionally, 
keep in mind that loss of situational awareness is often insidious and may not be obvious until the severity of the situation  
rises — then what?  
The following are some cues for recognizing a los s of SA.  
1. Fixation  — During emergencies, extended Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR)  tasks, or kinetic 
events.  
2. Distraction  — Zoning -out or silence to include the repetition of old information.  
3. Complacency  — The “I’ve done this a hu ndred times” trap.  
4. Gut feeling and/or confusion — Subconscious is delivering a warning which requires an action.  
5. Poor communication or slow to respond — Missed radio calls or challenge and response items.  
6. Failure to meet targets  — Low-level entry time, Estimated Time of Arrival ( ETA ) and/or Actual Time of Arrival 
(ATA)  discrepancies, checkpoints.  
7. Improper p rocedures  — Deviations from regulations , Rules of Engagement ( ROE )s, or checklist procedures.  
8. Unresolved discrepancies  — Two independent s ources disagree and remain unresolved.  
9. No one flying the aircraft  — Everyone is involved with other tasks.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 75 
Manifestations of these individual threats may be subtle and difficult to pick up. Attention threats and inappropriate 
motivations discussed earlier are some of the many ways loss of SA can present itself.  
Tools for Improving SA Aptitude  
It could be argued that, with practice, the resources required to maintain control in the most cognitively demanding situations can be efficiently used to ensure a successful outcome. The cognitive constructs and processes thought to 
underpin the SA process have received great attention by organizational and aviation psychology and now human 
factors engineers. The bottom -line is that SA doesn’t just happen, it requir es effort and practice. Here a few tools for 
improving SA:  
Tool 1: Constantly update SA threats  due to aircraft modifications . Stay up to speed on MDS improvements , revisions 
and updates.  
Tool 2: Improve reaction and perception time.  Examples: Mindbluff an d Humanbenchmark.com  
Tool 3: Stay smart of mishap trends involving LSA.  
Air Force Safety Automated System ( AFSAS ); Air Force Safety Center ( AFSEC ) monthly, quarterly, and annual 
data; Air Force Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance  (MFOQA ); Aviation  Safety Action Program ( ASAP ); 
Line Operations Safety Audit ( LOSA ); AP Professionals, Flight Surgeons, SQ/SE and WG/SE agencies  
Tool 4: Sense various environmental aspects  Examples: KIMs games  
Summary  
Whether it’s due to task fixation, distraction, supervisory pressure, or one of the numerous other causes, loss of SA continues to be a major cause of human factors -related mishaps. The challenge for the aviator is to first understand what 
SA is and how to build it. Then, by assessing their own risk for proble ms maintaining SA in flight as well as effective 
preflight, inflight, and post flight planning, and appropriate task delegation, the crewmember is on their way to preventing a loss of SA.  
Unfortunately, high levels of SA are not possible at all times on all missions. Therefore, it becomes imperative for aircrew to know the warning signs for diminishing SA, to recognize loss of SA in themselves and in others, and to rebuild SA through task prioritization and communication. Applying these and other attention management skills will improve the 
SA of the entire crew/flight and go a long way towards preventing human factors -related mishaps.

Introduction 
As “ground dwellers,” we’ve established a remarkable store of information about the “correctness” of two -dimensional 
movement within our environment. Over the years, we’ve relied on the accuracy of this information as input by our 
balance and orientation senses  — the visual system, the vestibular system of the inner ear, the somatosensory system 
(pressure receptors of the body), and the auditory system.  
When flying in visual meteorological conditions, all four sensory systems are wor king to provide for you spatial 
orientation relative to the earth’s surface. During instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), at night or in the weather, 
the eye does not provide adequate external visual information. As a result, the vestibular, somatose nsory, and auditory 
systems remain to process the complex motions and forces of flight. Information processed by these systems alone is 
unreliable because of the ease at which they automatically adjust to whatever aircraft attitude you’re flying, right or wrong. Under these conditions, your brain compares the information detected by your remaining senses to the two -
dimensional information you have relied on all your life. If they match, you remain oriented. However, a mismatch generates illusions capable of  quickly placing your senses in conflict with reality and causing spatial disorientation.  
Information  
Definition and Classification  
Definition  
Spatial disorientation ( SD) is defined as the inability to accurately orient yourself with respect to the earth’s  horizon 
(Davis et al. , 2008). We use four sensory systems to maintain our orientation and equilibrium (balance)  — the visual 
system, the vestibular system, the somatosensory system and the auditory system. These systems are effective when a 
person is on t he ground, in a 1 G environment performing normal activities. Collectively, they convey an accurate message 
of orientation and balance. Unfortunately, when these sensory systems are used in -flight, they are not reliable orientation 
indicators. This fact is especially evident when visual cues are lost or become confusing. Therefore, be aware of the mechanisms, functions,  and reactions of the sensory systems used for orientation in the flying environment.  
In the following sections, types of SD , sensory systems  and their related illusions, factors affecting SD , prevention of SD  
and recovery from SD  are discussed. Additionally, the causes and preventive measures of motion sickness are discussed.  
Classification  
Spatial disorientation is classified into three types . Each type has different characteristics posing different threats to the 
crewmember.  
Unrecognized Spatial Disorientation (Type I)  — Is the most dangerous type of SD  you can experience. Unrecognized 
SD occurs when you do not realize you are disoriented. In this case, you believe the aircraft is in a normal or desired 
attitude (pitch, roll, and/or yaw), when in reality the aircraft is  in a different or unusual attitude. Unrecognized SD  can 
occur while flying in clouds (no horizon) and relying on your vestibular and somatosensory systems to provide attitude 
information instead of the flight instruments. As a result, you think the aircra ft is flying straight and level, when in reality 
it may be in a 30° left bank and nose low. Unrecognized SD  can lead to controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), especially 
in high -speed, low -altitude environments.  
Recognized Spatial Disorientation (Type II)  — Is the least dangerous type of SD . You perform effective instrument 
cross- checks and identify the fact you are disoriented. As a result, you are able to recover from SD  using your flight 
instruments.  
The main purpose of SD  training is to enable you to m ove from unrecognized SD  to recognized SD . Recognizing SD  
allows for recovery of the aircraft or ejection (if necessary) before you are out of the ejection envelope.  
Incapacitating Spatial Disorientation (Type III)  — Occurs when you are so disoriented that  you are incapable of 
recovering even if it is recognized. Fortunately, this type of SD  is rarely experienced. However, there are documented 
cases where crewmembers realized they were disoriented, but were unable to recover because of the overwhelming 
sensory stimulation. In these cases, you can eject if you have the capability, or use other aids such as the autopilot or 
fellow crewmembers to help recover the aircraft.

Orientation Sensory Systems  
The visual system, the vestibular system, the somatosensory s ystem and the auditory system can all be “fooled” into 
believing what they sense is “true and accurate” in the flying environment.  
Information from each sensory system is sent to the brain, which coordinates all the input. If the input from each system 
agrees with the others, the individual is “oriented.” However, if there is a mismatch between the systems, three things 
can occur. The individual becomes disoriented, motion sick or both. Figure 8 -1 depicts the different sensory systems and 
their connections to the brain. The following describes the different systems, their function and their limitations in -flight.  
 
Figure 8 -1 — Sensory Systems  
The Visual System  
The eyes provide the strongest and, usually, the most reliable orientation information during flight. Recall from the Vision 
lesson, peripheral vision is the primary means the visual system uses to collect orientation cues. The orientation cues 
provided by the eyes are strong enough to overpower all other orientation system inputs. Orientation cues from the 
peripheral visual field are primarily processed subconsciously, at much faster speeds than information fr om your focal 
vision. As a result, a “straight line” within the visual field is perceived by your peripheral vision as a horizon, regardless 
of the “straight line’s” orientation to the surface of the Earth.  
Most of the time, the information the eyes receiv e is correct. For instance, if you become disoriented flying in clouds 
(because of confusing vestibular input), and then fly out of the clouds and acquire an accurate horizon, the disorientation 
disappears almost instantly. However, when the horizon acquir ed is not correct, your vestibular disorientation disappears, 
but you may still experience visual illusions caused by the false horizon.  
Visual illusions involving peripheral vision are difficult to avoid. Since information acquired by the peripheral visua l 
fields is processed subconsciously, you must use your focal vision (requiring conscious attention) to override the 
peripheral input. Use your focal vision by concentrating on the flight instruments to ensure the aircraft flies correctly. 
Unfortunately, i t’s difficult to override the peripheral visual inputs and it takes practice, discipline and concentration to 
accomplish. If flight instruments are not used when visual horizon inputs are lost due to flying in clouds, at night or in 
haze, the brain reverts  to the vestibular system for orientation information.  
The Vestibular System 
The vestibular system is located in the inner ear and consists of two subsystems  — the semicircular canals and the otolith 
organs. Designed to work on the ground, they are respons ible for two different categories of illusions in -flight depending 
on which subsystem is stimulated. If the semicircular canals are stimulated, the illusions are categorized as somatogyral 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 82 
illusions. If the otolith organs are stimulated, the illusions are somatogravic illusions. Figure 8 -2 illustrates the vestibular 
system.  
The Semicircular Canals  — Located in each inner ear. There are three canals in each ear, oriented at right angles to one 
another in the pitch (vertical), roll (lateral), and yaw (horizon tal) axes. They measure angular acceleration caused when 
the head is turned or tilted. For the semicircular canals to sense angular acceleration, the acceleration must reach a 
threshold in the range of 0.14°/sec2 to .5°/sec2 actual movement.  
Each semicirc ular canal contains a fluid called endolymph, 
which is stimulated into motion when the head accelerates 
in the axis of the canal. When the head is accelerated, the 
fluid in the canal lags behind because of inertia. As a result, 
the apparent motion of the f luid is in the opposite direction 
of the acceleration. This motion causes a concentration of 
specialized nerve cells called the cupula to bend in the 
direction of the fluid motion. The bending of the cupula 
sends a signal to the brain which interprets the signal as 
changes in position or attitude. Use Figure 8 -3, A and B for 
the following example. If a person rotates their head to the 
right, the acceleration causes the displacement of the fluid 
to the left and the cupula bends to the right. The brain 
interp rets the bending of the cupula to the right as angular 
motion to the right.  
On the ground, the semicircular canals are an excellent complement to vision as an orientation system. However, in -
flight and without adequate visual cues, the semicircular 
canals have a strong and unreliable orientation input to the brain. Additionally, input from the semicircular canals can be 
strong enough to cause muscles to react and attempt to keep a crewmember upright.  
There are maneuvers that stimulate the semicircular canal s for extended periods of time. If the angular acceleration 
continues at a constant rate for a period of 10 to 20 seconds, the motion of the fluid in the canals equalizes with the 
motion of the canals. When equalization occurs, the apparent motion of the f luid is zero, the cupula are not deflected, 
and the brain receives a false impression that rotation has stopped (Figure 8 -3, C). Therefore, in the absence of visual 
cues, you do not perceive you are in a bank, descent, or climb. If the motion stops or decelerates, the inertia of the endolymph causes it to continue in the original direction of acceleration. This stopping or deceleration results in the cupula being deflected in the opposite direction of the original acceleration (Figure 8 -3, D). As a result, you experience 
the sensation of moving in the opposite direction of your original maneuver.  
 
Figure 8 -3 — Semicircular Canal and Angular Acceleration  
An example of the effect of angular acceleration on the semicircular canals in -flight occurs when you ent er a holding 
pattern while in the weather. In this case, the absence of a visual horizon results in the semicircular canal input being 
used for orientation. As you enter the holding turn, you roll the aircraft to 30 degrees of right bank (stimulating the r oll 
canal) and beg in a 180- degree turn, taking one minute . Within 10 to 20 seconds of the initiation of the turn, the endolymph 
 
Figure 8 -2 — Vestibular System Anatomy  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 83 
equalizes and there is no physical sensation of being in a bank. When you roll out of the turn, the fluid in the canal 
continues  to move and displaces the cupula in the opposite direction. You sense the aircraft in an opposite left bank of 
the same magnitude as your initial bank when in reality you are in straight -and-level flight. If you are not using your 
flight instruments, you may react to the sensation of being in an opposite bank by rolling into a right bank to make your 
head “feel right.” All three semicircular canals work on the principle depicted in Figure 8 -3 (response to angular 
acceleration) and more than one canal can b e stimulated at a time.  
 
Figure 8 -4 — Otolith Organs and Linear Acceleration  
The Otolith Organs  — Located near the base of the semicircular canals in the vestibular apparatus and sense linear 
acceleration (refer to Figure 8 -4). They consist of a base of n erve cells with hair like appendages that are embedded in a 
gelatinous substance containing calcium carbonate crystals. As you tilt your head forward, the crystals slide forward and the nerves signal the brain that the head is tilted forward. Conversely, i f you tilt your head back, the crystals slide 
backwards and the nerves signal the brain that a backward tilt is occurring. In -flight, forward or backward linear 
accelerations cause the crystals to slide backwards or forwards respectively in response to the inertial force. For instance, 
if you accelerate forward, the crystals slide to the rear and, in the absence of a visual horizon, you sense the aircraft is 
pitching up. Conversely, a rapid deceleration causes you to sense the aircraft is pitching down. In either case, you may 
react by pulling back on the stick or yoke or pushing forward to compensate for the perceived change in pitch attitude. Figure 8 -4 shows the function of the otolith organs in normal situations and in response to linear accelerations.  
The Somatosensory System  
The somatosensory system consists of tactile pressure receptors in the skin, muscles, tendons,  and joints. The pressure 
receptors are used to help maintain posture and balance. The somatosensory system is often called the “seat -of-the-pants” 
sense. Unfortunately, in- flight, the somatosensory system is useless as an orientation system in the absence of correct 
visual cues. Because most flight maneuvers are made in the positive -G environment, there are no variations in pressure 
cues. T herefore, the somatosensory system does not receive adequate input to tell the somatosensory receptors if the 
aircraft is in a bank, nose up, nose down or inverted attitude.  
The Auditory System  
The auditory system can help maintain situational awareness a nd spatial orientation through feedback. This feedback is 
related to aircraft speed and its relationship to the noise produced by the aerodynamic forces acting upon the aircraft. For 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 84 
example, in IMC, increasing airstream noise may indicate an undesired nos e down attitude. This auditory information 
should cause you to check your instruments and take corrective action, if required.  
Vestibular  Induced Spatial Disorientation 
The visual, vestibular and somatosensory systems work together to tell you where you ar e in relation to your environment. 
You can look at these three systems as a tripod, remaining stable as long as all three systems are working correctly. 
However, if one of these systems is not working correctly, it is like removing a leg from the tripod, w hich then becomes 
unstable. In -flight, the visual system is most likely to be lost. When loss of visual information occurs, you receive a 
majority of your orientation information from the vestibular system. Unfortunately, the vestibular system is very easy  to 
corrupt and can readily provide erroneous information. The vestibular system also has a very strong input to 
neuromuscular pathways which, if the stimulus is strong enough, can cause you to reflexively move the aircraft controls 
in undesired directions . Most of the time, however, vestibular stimulation results from mild accelerations and leads to 
Type I/Unrecognized SD . Remember, vestibular illusions occur primarily in the absence of peripheral visual cues.  
Illusions caused by each of the vestibular sys tems are discussed in the following section. Illusions caused by the interface 
between the vestibular and visual system (vestibulo -ocular illusions) are also discussed.  
Somatogyral Illusions  
Somatogyral illusions are caused by the stimulation of the semicircular canals due to angular acceleration. In this illusion, after you return to straight -and-level flight, you sense the aircraft is turning or banking in the opposite direction. Three 
major somatogyral illusions can occur in -flight  — the Leans, the Graveyard spin/spiral and the Coriolis illusion.  
The Leans — The most common vestibular illusion experienced in -flight. It is caused when the semicircular canal 
responsible f or sensing acceleration in the roll axis is stimulated. If during the course of flight the aircraft is allowed to 
roll at a rate below the threshold, in the absence of any reliable visual cues, the roll will not be perceived. Once you 
realize the aircraft is in a roll or bank, however, you may correct with a roll in the opposite direction at a roll rate greater 
than threshold. As a result, you will perceive a bank or roll in the opposite direction even though you thought you were 
in a wings -level attitude. In  some instances, you may find yourself physically leaning back to the opposite direction of 
the perceived bank, hence the term “the leans.”  
Additionally, if the initial roll rate is greater than the threshold, the acceleration is great enough to cause th e sensation of 
“roll.” Once the acceleration stops (motion may continue but at a constant rate), the endolymph reaches equilibrium and the cupula is not displaced. At this point, you don’t perceive the aircraft is in a bank or roll. When the aircraft rolls  out to 
a wings -level attitude, the angular momentum of the endolymph, moving in the direction of the original bank or roll, 
continues because of inertia. The cupula is deflected in the opposite direction of the original bank and you perceive an 
opposite bank or roll of the same magnitude as the original maneuver, when in reality you are wings -level. If the roll to 
wings -level (deceleration) is rapid enough, you may physically “lean” in the opposite direction of the perceived roll or 
bank (Figure 8 -5).

UNCLASSIFIED 85 
  
  
Figure 8 -5 — The Leans  
The Graveyard Spin/Spiral  — An example of how deadly 
somatogyral illusions can be when flying in conditions of reduced 
visibility (night or instrument weather). Because of the mechanics of 
the semicircular canals, you become dis oriented quickly when your 
aircraft is placed in a spin or spiraling turn (with no distinct horizon). 
To help illustrate the graveyard spin or spiral, let’s use a crew who 
unintentionally spins their T -6 (to the left) into the clouds. The crew 
correctly perceives the initial spin direction because the angular 
acceleration causes the endolymph to displace the cupula in the yaw 
canals. However, as the spin continues at a constant rate, the 
endolymph stabilizes and the cupula are no longer deflected. The crew perceives a slowing and eventual stopping of the spin. When they 
check their instruments, they realize they are in a spin and apply the 
appropriate spin recovery procedures, stopping the aircraft from 
spinning. Because of the angular deceleration caused by  the crew’s 
application of the correction procedures, they perceive a spin to the 
right even though the aircraft is no longer spinning. If they are not aware of the possibility of this illusion, they may think they have 
entered a right spin, apply the spin  recovery procedures for a right spin, 
and reenter a spin in the original direction.  
The graveyard spiral illusion occurs in situations where there is poor 
visibility and you are flying in instrument conditions. To illustrate this illusion, let’s use the c rew of an AC -130 gunship orbiting above a 
target with poor visibility at night. In this situation, the aircraft rolls 
into a turn with a moderate (30 degrees) amount of bank. After a 
number of seconds, the crew loses the sensation of turning because of 
the stabilization of the semicircular canals. Since the crew does not 
receive adequate input from their other sensory systems, they lose 
sensation of the increased bank. When the aircraft rolls wings -level, 
the crew feels they are not only turning in the oppo site direction but 
also as if the aircraft is in an opposite bank. Unwilling to accept the sensation of making a wrong control input, the aircraft is rolled back 
into the original banked turn. Returning to the original banked turn 
satisfies the crew’s sens ation of straight -and-level flight, but the instruments show the aircraft is still turning and losing 
altitude (a banked aircraft loses lift and as a result can lose altitude). Believing the aircraft is flying straight and level but 
 
Figure 8 -6 — The Graveyard Spin/Spiral  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 86 
losing altitude, the cr ew tries to stop the descent by adding power and pulling back on the yoke (which would normally 
stop the descent). Unfortunately, the aircraft is in a bank and pulling back on the yoke only tightens the turn. Unless you 
are aware of this illusion, properly  interpret and believe your instruments, and make the necessary corrections, you will 
continue to descend in an ever tightening spiral. Figure 8 -6 illustrates the graveyard spin/spiral.  
The Coriolis Illusion  — Occurs when two or more of the semicircular canals are stimulated (Figure 8 -7). All 
crewmembers are susceptible to this illusion. The crewmember perceives a tumbling sensation that can be 
overwhelmingly disorienting. In the aircraf t, the Coriolis illusion  occurs in situations where the aircraft is tur ning, rolling,  
or changing pitch and the crewmember moves their head out of the plane of motion. To illustrate this, consider a fighter 
crew turning their heads to look at the placement of their bombs while pulling off the target. The aircraft is climbing and 
turning when the crew turn their heads to look over their shoulders. As they turn their heads they stimulate the yaw canal and perceive the aircraft is pitching down and rolling. Their initial reaction is to pull back on the stick and roll to an 
attitu de they think is wings -level. Unfortunately, they don’t roll to a wings -level attitude and may impact the ground.  
 
Figure 8 -7 — The Coriolis Illusion  
The Giant -Hand Phenomenon 
The giant -hand phenomenon is a subconscious reflex behavior, generated by vestibular inputs interfering with your 
conscious control of the aircraft. It is largely thought of as a somatogyral illu sion but can be experienced as a somatogravic 
illusion. The giant -hand phenomenon occurs when the vestibular stimulus is so strong that you cannot physically 
overcome the sensation of an opposite bank or roll. As a result, you reflexively roll the aircraft back to the original bank 
angle to defeat the sensation of opposite bank and cannot maintain a wings -level attitude. One pilot explained the 
phenomenon felt like a giant hand was pressing down on the wing of his aircraft. However, it’s believed the false vestibular input results in a muscular reflex causing you to return the aircraft to an attitude eliminating the sensation of 
pitch or bank.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 87 
To overcome this illusion, you should 
momentarily remove your hand from the aircraft 
controls to interrupt the reflex response from the illusion.  
Somatogravic Illusions  
Somatogravic illusions are caused by linear accelerations. The otolith organs respond to linear acceleration forces and the illusions 
usually involve the sensation of pitching up or 
down. However, there  are other somatogravic 
illusions that are caused by G -forces and turns. 
The most common somatogravic illusions are the pitch -up/pitch -down illusion and the G -
excess effect.  
Pitch -up/Pitch Down Illusion — The illusion 
or sensation of pitching up or down wh en 
exposed to a linear acceleration. In the absence 
of a visible horizon, this illusion can be 
dangerous. If the aircraft accelerates rapidly, 
you can feel a pitch up motion caused by the otoliths sliding backwards in response to the acceleration. If you a re not 
paying attention to the instruments, you may react by pushing the nose of the aircraft over to compensate for the perceived 
increase in pitch. Conversely, if the aircraft decelerates rapidly, you can perceive a pitch down motion caused by the 
otoliths sliding forward. You may pull the nose up to compensate for the perceived nose down attitude. As a result, the 
aircraft could stall. Figure 8 -8 illustrates the pitch -up illusion.   
The G -Excess Effect  — Occurs when the aircraft is in a turn and you are looking outside the aircraft with your head up, 
towards the inside of the turn, or head -down looking towards the outside of the turn (Figure 8 -9). The otolith organs 
respond to both the tilt of the head and the G force caused by the turn. If you are looking inside the turn, your head is 
tilted up with respect to the axis of the aircraft and turned sideways. The G force caused by the turn causes the otolith 
organs to slide towards the back of the head. The sensation perceived is a decrease in the bank angle. As a result, you 
perceive you are not banked as much as you should be, and you increase the bank; the nose of the aircraft begins to drop 
below the horizon and the aircraft loses altitude. This illusion  is particularly dangerous if you are operating in a low -level 
environment. This illusion can also be dangerous when trying to turn the aircraft immediately after takeoff or during 
approach.

Factors Affecting Spatial Disorien tation  
There are many factors influencing crewmembers’ susceptibility to SD. For the purposes of this course, they are divided 
into two major classifications, environmental and physiological.  
 
Figure 8 -8 — Pitch -up Illusion  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 88 
Environmental Factors  
Environmental factors affecting spatial disorientation are those you have little or no control over. They include such 
things as the flight weather, type of mission, time of day of the mission and duration of the mission. Environmental 
factors also include cockpit and aircraft design and other air craft engineering factors you cannot influence. Knowing 
these factors and how they can influence your susceptibility to spatial disorientation is important for safe flight.  
Weather restricts visual cues used for orientation and can cause SD. Being aware of  the forecast weather and the possible 
problems that could be encountered enroute greatly increases your capability to prevent a SD  incident. If you know you 
are going to encounter IMC conditions, you can mentally prepare yourself for instrument flight. Ho wever, if you find 
yourself in an unexpected IMC situation, especially at a point in the mission where you are fatigued, you may be more susceptible to SD . For example, you encounter expected weather at your landing base. Therefore, you are prepared for a 
more difficult approach and can plan accordingly. Conversely, if you unexpectedly find yourself in the weather at your 
landing base, you may find yourself trying to change and replan the approach into the field. If this situation occurs, there 
is a higher chance for errors at a critical phase of the mission. This situation is compounded if you are mentally or 
physically fatigued.  
Type of Mission  can have an effect on the susceptibility to SD . Missions requiring formation flying at night or in marginal 
weath er are likely situations for SD . Other types of missions, such as low -level missions or missions requiring night air 
refuelings, can also lead to SD . 
Time of Mission and Mission Duration can change your perception based on the environment and your body physiological status. You must be prepared to fly any time of the day or night, in any weather for an extended period of 
time. Your ability to prepare and prevent SD  mishaps from occurring depends on your awareness of the threats, mission 
preparation,  and the  physiological factors involved in SD . The fatigue that results from disruptions in your circadian 
cycle greatly increases your susceptibility to SD . 
Physiological Factors  
Physiological factors are those you have some control over. These factors are thorou ghly discussed in the “ Performance 
Threats Management ” lesson. These factors are reviewed here to reinforce how influential they are in regards to SD  and 
include alcohol, self -medication, dehydration,  and fatigue.  
Alcohol  increases your susceptibility to S D even though you may have stopped drinking within the time limits mandated 
by regulation. Alcoh ol can produce nystagmus that can last  up to 72 hours, depending on the amount  of alcohol  ingested. 
So, for 12 to 72 hours after ingesting alcohol, you have an increased susceptibility to SD. Additionally, the side effects 
of alcohol increase fatigue and dehydration, slowing your perceptual abilities and increasing your susceptibility to SD . 
Self-Medication  usually occurs when you do not feel well. Unfortunately,  self-medicating increases your susceptibility 
to SD by increasing fatigue levels, depressing the central nervous system, causing dehydration, and can have a synergistic 
effect with the illness. For example, a crewmember who is flying with a cold and takin g over -the-counter cold medicines 
to control congestion and fever, combines the depressant effect of the cold medicine with the fatigue resulting from the 
cold. This may cause them to be less alert and fail to recognize the SD  situation, possibly resulting  in a mishap.  
Dehydration , in the flying environment causes you to fatigue more quickly, increasing susceptibility to spatial 
disorientation. Your ability to recognize and correct for illusions also decreases, placing you and your crew at a 
disadvantage.  
Mental or physical fatigue  increases your susceptibility to SD  by decreasing your ability to react and perceive what is 
occurring. Additionally, when you are tired, your ability to accumulate and process information slows down. This effect means some cockpi t tasks are relegated to the subconscious level. Unfortunately, the subconscious level relies on the 
vestibular system for orientation cues in the absence of peripheral vision cues. Therefore, if you are fatigued and find 
yourself in a situation where you can become disoriented, there is a greater chance the SD  will be unrecognized. Fatigue 
also slows your ability to analyze and overcome the SD. It’s every crewmember’s responsibility to ensure they are 
sufficiently rested, both physically and mentally, to f ly the mission.  
Other Factors Affecting SD  
Several other factors can influence SD. These factors include your experience in flying in IMC conditions, mission 
preparation,  and your recency of experience (how long ago  you flew in these conditions).  
Experience in IMC  — The more you fly in IMC, the better able you are to cope with its specific demands. A high time 
IMC crewmember will probably be better able to anticipate the situations that may cause SD  (rolling out of a turn, moving 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 89 
your head to change a switch positi on, etc.) than a low time IMC crewmember. However, when SD  is involved, there is 
no guarantee a high time IMC crewmember will be less susceptible to SD  than a low time IMC crewmember.  
Mission Preparation  — Also has a direct effect on your susceptibility to  SD. During mission planning sessions, review 
the portions of the mission that could present problems. Also evaluate your experience level with this type of mission. If 
it’s a regularly flown mission, you are likely to be aware of the possible hazards. How ever, if the mission is flown 
infrequently, the hazards must be briefed accordingly. For multi -place aircraft, develop a plan and procedures to use in -
flight should the pilot flying the aircraft become disoriented. For example, the pilot team should have a  clear plan of 
attack for handling SD. 
Recency of Experience — How often, and when, you have flown a certain type of mission. A crewmember with lots of 
recent day, VMC low -level experience is not necessarily proficient doing night, IMC, low -level missions. Therefore, a 
crewmember may be more susceptible to SD durin g night low -level missions since the usual day, VFR visual cues aren’t 
available.  
Good cockpit resource management is vital in situations where SD  may occur. Effective communication between 
crewmembers can prevent or decrease the possibility of an SD  incid ent by maintaining awareness of what the aircraft is 
doing and where it is in relation to the ground.  
Spatial Disorientation  Prevention  
You can prevent SD  occurrences by employing a variety of tools. The most important tools are your knowledge and 
awarenes s of SD , its causes,  and what you can do to prevent an SD  mishap. You need to understand your limitations, be 
prepared to remedy correctable factors, properly use your capabilities, recognize high risk situations,  and stay alert . 
Understand Limitations  
Planning, training and awareness help keep you within your limits and prevent  you from finding yourself in a SD  situation 
you neither expected nor are capable of coping with. During mission planning, identify and understand your individual limitations and you r crews’ collective limitations to minimize the SD  threat. Also, understand the limitations of your 
orientation systems and the illusions caused by the absence of clear visual cues.  
Remedy Correctable Factors  
Understanding limitations helps you identify and remedy correctable factors. For example, when was the last time you 
flew in instrument conditions? If you are noncurrent or have not recently flown in instrument conditions, request a 
simulator (if available) or fly simulated instrument conditions with a n instructor. Be aware of experience levels and 
maintain coordination with fellow crewmembers. Thoroughly plan and brief the mission, identify those portions of the flight where SD is a major threat, form a plan to prevent an SD  occurrence, and what action s to take if disorientation does 
occur.  
All crewmembers must remain acutely aware of where the aircraft is in relation to the ground at all times. Every 
crewmember on the aircraft should know the responsibilities of other crewmembers in order to effectivel y back each 
other up, particularly in high threat situations.  
Use Capabilities Properly  
Use your individual and collective capabilities properly and do not overextend yourself to the point of exceeding your 
limits. Ensure you’re aware of where the aircraft  is in relation to the ground and notify fellow crewmembers of any 
deviation to aircraft attitude, altitude, and position. You must know the altitudes, airspeeds,  and rough headings to be 
flown. Collectively, the crewmembers must use their knowledge and aw areness of the aircraft, mission,  and SD to keep 
the aircraft within safe operating limits.  
Recognize High Risk Situations  
During mission planning, identify and recognize any high risk situations that may occur during the flight. For instance, if you fly a  low-level route, identify factors increasing susceptibility to SD  (like a moonless night or weather hazards on 
the low -level route). Additionally, other situations, such as time of day of the flight and fatigue factors need to be 
considered. After recogni zing the high risk situations, you can develop a plan to minimize or eliminate the SD  risk while 
still completing the mission. Furthermore, you cannot forget that you are vulnerable to SD  from takeoff  to landing.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 90 
Stay Alert!  
Finally, stay alert to the fact that SD can be a threat at any time  during the flight. You must be aware that even though 
you have completed the high threat portions of the mission, SD  can still occur. For example, although the night, low -
level portion of the mission is complete, the mission is not a success until the aircraft lands. And although the crew may 
be fatigued, everyone must remain alert. All crewmembers must actively monitor the approach airspeeds and altitudes to 
back up  the pilot flying the aircraft. Always back each other up to ensure the mission is complete without loss of aircraft 
or crew.  
Overcoming Spatial Disorientation  
If you become spatially disoriented, you must transition from 
unrecognized SD to recognized SD  as rapidly as possible. 
Recognizing and correcting for SD  is vital to the safety and 
survival of crew and aircraft. You can ensure the crew corrects and 
overcomes SD by using the following proce dures (summarized in 
Figure 8 -10). 
1. Transition to Instruments  
A highly disciplined instrument cross -check is the ke y to recovery 
from SD (especially while flying at night, in the weather and in 
formation). Removing ambient visual cues, by leaning forward, should place any distractions from canopy glare outside your peripheral visual field. Additionally, leaning forward causes 
the horizon line on the attitude indicator to fill a larger area of your visual field. The longer the line, the easier it is to keep your attention.  
Immediately recognize and correct unusual deviations in attitude, altitude, airspeed,  or position f rom the planned flight 
profile. Consciously suppress vestibular sensations by concentrating on your instruments and avoid fixating on any one thing.  
2. Believe the Instruments  
You must learn to ignore, overcome,  or control false sensations perceived from y our senses. Remember, the gauges are 
right. If the instruments indicate you are u pside down, then you are  upside down!  
Note  — In some cases where the pilot flying the aircraft is severely disoriented, the copilot and/or the navigator  must also 
transition to instruments and prepare to assume control of the aircraft or initiate an ejection.  
3. Back -up the Pilot Flying on Instruments  
In multiplace aircraft, the pilot not flying the aircraft or the nav igator  must ensure the pilot flying the aircraft takes the 
correct actions to recover the aircraft in a SD  situation.  
4. Minimize Head Movements  
Avoid excessive head movements when flying form ation in weather and briefly glance at your gauges using your eyes 
only. If you feel your head is spinning, rest your head a gainst the seat back. Doing so reduces the chance of restimulating 
the vestibular system and the spinning sensation should subside within seconds.  
5. Fly Straight and Level  
30 to 60 seconds of straight -and-level flight while concentrating on your instruments should settle your semicircular 
canals. When flying formation, in the weather, on the wing you can become disoriented more easily because your attention is focused on the lead aircraft’s position and not on your gauges. Under these conditions, the lead aircraft is 
your primary attitude indicator . Any unexpected attitude changes by the lead can further disorient you. Get to VMC if 
possible. In some fighter aircraft, the navigator can assume control and return the aircraft to straight -and-level flight if 
necessary.  
6. Be Prepared to Transfer/Assume Control  
The pilot should transfer control to the other pilot (in mult i-place aircraft) or the WSO  (fighter aircraft), if possible, 
because it is rare to have all crewmembers simultaneously disoriented. Use the au topilot to reduce task saturation and 
SD, but remember to maintain a constant cross -check of the instruments. Do not allow the autopilot to fly you into the 
ground.   
Figure 8 -10 — Overcom ing SD  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 91 
In fighters, the WSO  can talk the pilot through the recovery procedures or ask for control of the aircraft.  
7. Egress  
If orientation cannot be reestablished, particularly during critical phases of flight, ejection or bailout may be your only 
chance for survival. In aircraft with ejection seats, you must be intimately familiar with your ejection seat’s parameters 
(the ejection envelope). You must preplan how long you will attempt to recover the aircraft before ejection. Therefore, 
the decision to eject is determined during mission planning and not in the air.  The loss of an aircraft because of SD  is 
undesirable but the preventable loss of crewmembers is unforgivable.  
Formation Flights  
The potential for SD  is greatest for formation flights during night or weather conditions. Crewmembers scheduled for 
formation flights in night/IMC should be current and proficient in instrument, night,  and formation flying. The flight 
leader in the preflight briefing should cover specific procedures to manage a disoriented wingman.  
There are two essential requirements for safe formation flight in weather. One, the fli ght leader must be experienced and 
competent . Two, the wingman must be proficient in formation flying. The wingman must have total confidence in lead 
and concentrate primarily on maintaining a proper wing position.  
If weather encountered during formation f light is either too dense or turbulent to ensure safe flight, the flight leader 
should separate the aircraft under controlled conditions.  
The flight lead should encourage a wingman to verbalize any feelings of disorientation. A few words from lead can 
reassure the wingman and may help form a mental picture of the flight’s position in space.  
Assuming the flight lead position may allow the wingman to transition to instruments and recover from the disorientation.  
Motion Sickness  
The exact cause of motion sick ness is unknown. However, the most widely accepted theory proposes motion sickness is 
caused by “sensory conflict.” According to this theory, there is a conflict between the visual and vestibular system or 
between different components of the vestibular sys tem. For example, flying with your head down in the cockpit during 
aerial maneuvers sets up a mismatch between the vestibular system (sensing the accelerations of the maneuvers) and the 
visual system (deprived of visual motion cues). The result of the mism atch is motion sickness. Susceptibility to motion 
sickness is increased by anxiety, fear, fatigue, dehydration, hypoglycemia,  and disease. Heat, lack of air flow, an 
inadequate visual horizon or blocked visibility are environmental factors that may also in crease susceptibility to motion 
sickness.  
Symptoms  
The symptoms of motion sickness are nausea, sweating, belching, cold and clammy feeling, and headache. In some cases, active vomiting occurs and sometimes prostration (inability to remain standing). The de velopment and intensity of these 
symptoms depends on individual susceptibility, previous experience, frame of mind,  and environmental stimuli.  
Prevention  
Motion sickness decreases if good outside visual references exist. However, these references are not always available, 
but there are other tools you can use to help prevent motion sickness.  
One of the most important tools available to prevent motion sickness is your ability to eliminate or minimize self- imposed 
stress. You should be well hydrated before fl ight and continue to drink water during the flight. You should also ensure 
you are flying with some food in your stomach. Bland, starchy foods, like bread or crackers, help absorb excess acids 
produced by the stomach. Eliminate or severely decrease your co nsumption of alcohol in the 24 to 48 hours prior to 
flight. Finally, you should be well rested to concentrate on the mission, from beginning to end.  
Treatment  
Acquiring a good outside visual reference will usually remove the symptoms. Sometimes, cool air b lowing across the 
body decreases the symptoms and breathing 100 percent oxygen also helps. If the symptoms persist, you can employ a technique known as diaphragmatic breathing to help the symptoms subside.  When diaphragmatic breathing, close your 
mouth and  inhale slowly through your nose. Your abdomen should expand more than your chest. This helps to prevent 
air swallowing and hyperventilation and seeks to stimulate the vagus nerve to pass gastric contents down stream. Then 
slowly exhale through your mouth. Puckering your lips helps to control the escape of air. Continue at a slow, comfortable 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 92 
pace. Resume normal breat hing if you begin to feel dizzy; you may be hyperventilating. Also, resume normal breathing 
once your airsickness symptoms have been controlled . 
Post-airsickness Procedures  
In the event you become airsick, you must see a flight surgeon to ensure there are no underlying physiological illnesses 
that caused the episode.  
Summary  
SD is the inability of a person to accurately orient themselves with res pect to the surface of the Earth. SD  is categorized 
as Type I/Unrecognized (the most dangerous), Type II/Recognized (the least dangerous) and Type III/Incapacitating (rare, but dangerous).  
The visual system is the primary mode of orientation. However, when  the visual cues are removed (instrument flight 
conditions), the vestibular system becomes the primary source of orientation information. Unfortunately, in- flight, the 
vestibular system and somatosensory system are not only powerful but also untrustworthy.  
Recognizing the environmental and physiological factors affecting susceptibility to SD helps you control them. The 
environmental factors (those you cannot control) include weather, type of mission, the time of day and duration of the 
mission. The physiolo gical factors (those you can control) include self -imposed stresses, mental and physical fatigue, 
emotional well-being,  and flight preparation.  
You can help prevent SD  by knowing your limitations, remedying correctable factors, using your capabilities properly, 
recognizing high risk situations,  and staying alert. If you become disoriented, transition to instruments and believe the 
instruments. Basically, “Get on the instruments and make them read right !” SD is overcome by knowledge and 
awareness, effective crew coordination and minimized exposure to self -imposed stresses.

Information  
Your instructor will conclude Spatial Disorientation education with disorientation demonstrations in the Barany chair 
(Figure 9 -1). The Barany chair is a rotational seating d evice used to generate a response to motion within a trainee’s 
vestibular system. Training applications for this device include spatial disorientation familiarization training and 
airsickness desensitization training . 
Vestibulocular reflexes and somatogyra l/oculogyral illusions can be demonstrated via the Barany chair by limiting 
additional orientation information from the visual, auditory, or somatosensory system. Instructors may direct various 
positioning causing an increased reaction in trainees, and pro viding a notable effect on the trainee’s ability to interpret 
their orientation in two dimensional space.  
Student volunteers will assist in the demonstration of various vestibular illusions. Each student will witness a volunteer 
student (or students) accom plish each of the illusions. Not all students will accomplish the Barany Chair demonstration 
due to time constraints. However, each student will receive training in the Spatial Dis orientation trainer in Lesson AP118. 
Management of the Barany Chair demo and  time constraints is based on the judgment of the instructor.  
Note  — Training device lesson hours are per student. Training schedule time must  compensate for training device 
capacity and size of training class.

Introduction 
Noise and  vibration are other  stress ors you must cope with during flight and ground operations. In this lesson, the 
characteristics of sound, how the human perceives sound, and the effects of both short - and long- term exposure to nois e 
and the problems of noise -induced hearing loss and methods used to preven t hearing loss will be discussed . The 
characteristics of vibration will also be covered, in addition to their effects on performance (e.g., reaction time, visual 
impairment, and  fatigue).  
Information  
Noise  
Exposure to high intensity noise, like that produced by jet engines, can damage hearing sensitivity, resulting in permanent 
or temporary deafness. There are other effects of noise exposure that can be just as harmful. For instance, sleep 
disturbances, mental fatigue, and stress reactions can occur from overexposure to noise. Various factors influence the 
degree noise affects the hearing of exposed individuals. Crewmembers exposed to noisy environments must understand 
the risks o f noise exposure, probability of permanent hearing loss, and preventive measures to protect their hearing.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 98 
Definition and Characteristics of Noise 
Noise is unwanted sound. The characteristics of noise of 
concern to you are frequency and intensity of the no ise, 
duration of exposure to the noise, and distance from the 
noise source. Noise becomes hazardous as a result of these 
characteristics.  
Frequency  — Sound waves are created by the alternate 
compression and rarefication  of air, above and below 
atmospheric pressure respectively. The number of times each second that these oscillations occur is referred to as the frequency. By convention, one oscillatio n per second is 
termed one Hertz (Hz). Therefore, a frequency of 100 cycles per second is 100 Hz. The human ear is normally 
receptive to frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz. This is 
referred to as the audible range. Frequency is also referred 
to as pitch.  
As a person becomes older, they naturally lose hearing in the higher frequencies (above 4,000 Hz). Crewmembers, however, tend to lose hearing in the upper -mid frequencies 
and show hearing loss in frequencies that relate to the type 
of aircraft they fly. F or instance, crewmembers flying 
multi -place aircraft, such as P -3s and C -130s, show 
frequency loss in different ranges than those crewmembers 
flying fighter -type aircraft.  
Most noise that a crewmember is exposed to consists of many different frequencies (b road band), like an airplane at full 
thrust. However, there are instances where the crewmember is exposed to predominantly single -frequency noise (narrow 
band). In environments where there is narrow band, high intensity noise, more damage occurs to the cre wmember’s 
hearing.  
Intensity  — The magnitude of an acoustic event and is a measure of pressure of sound waves in the ear canal. Sound 
pressure levels increase millions of times between the normal threshold of human hearing and the maximum safe level. To av oid the use of awkward numbers, a more convenient term, the decibel (dB), is used to measure these pressures. The 
decibel is a logarithmic expression of the ratio of the sound pressure being measured to the lowest sound pressure 
detectable by the normal hu man ear at 1,000 Hz. As an example of the logarithmic nature of the expression dB, the sound 
pressure buffeting the eardrum increases 100 times between 100 and 120 dB. Figure 10- 1 illustrates several common 
noise situations and their corresponding intensit y levels. Figure 10 -2 provides noise intensities of various aircraft.  
Numbers are based on ground readings for aircraft flying 1000’ overhead.

Figure 10 -2 — Aircraft Noise Levels  
The intensity threshold at which hum ans are susceptible to  hearing loss i s 85 dB. At noise levels of 85 dB and above, 
hearing protection should be worn. A rule of thumb used to gauge whether certain noise levels are intense enough to 
require protection is the “shout test.” If one has to shout to be heard at a distance of one me ter, then the noise level is 
intense enough to require hearing protection. The threshold for pain is 130 dB and physical damage occurs at noise levels 
of 150 dB and above.  
Distance plays an important role in determining how hazardous a noise source may be.  If noise traveled through the air 
efficiently (perfect conditions) there is a 6 dB decrease in intensity as distance from the source is doubled (beyond 30 meters from the source). For instance, if a jet aircraft starter unit (JASU) is emitting 100 dB at 3 0 meters, and you are 
standing 60 meters from the JASU, you are exposed to 94 dB. If you stood at 120 meters, the intensity drops to 88 dB. 
However, the intensity may be modified by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.  
The length of exposure  to noise plays a fundamental role in 
determining how much irreversible damage is inflicted on your hearing. Figure 10 -3 depicts the time a human can be 
exposed to different intensities of noise without protection. 
The rule for figuring exposure times  is for every 3 dB 
increase, the time of exposure is reduced by one -half. For 
instance, the maximum allowable time unprotected exposure 
to 85 dB is eight hours. If the noise intensity is increased to 
88 dB, the allowable time of exposure is four hours. At 112 
dB, the maximum allowable exposure is less than one minute.  
Environmental factors that affect sound transmission through 
the air can either increase or decrease the intensity of noise. 
Terrain, wind direction, wind velocity and air density significantl y affect the intensity of the noise at a given 
distance.  
Perception of Sound 
The human ear is divided into three sections  — the external ear, middle ear and inner ear. Figure 10 -4 shows the anatomy 
of the human ear. For one to perceive and identify sound, the signal must be converted from the mechanical energy of 
sound waves to ele ctrical energy. The electrical energy is then transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve.

Figure 10 -4 — Perception of Sound  
The external ear collects sound waves and directs them to the middle ear. The middle ear consists of an eardrum and 
three small bones (ossicles), acting to transmit sound (vibrations) from the external ear to the inner ear. The vibrations 
are transmitted into the spiral- shaped, fluid- filled cochlea of the inner ear. Vibrations received by the cochlea set up a 
fluid motion which is perceived by tiny hair cells. These hair cells are connected to the auditory nerve. Movement of the 
hair cells caused by fluid motion results in the production of nerve impulses. These impulses flow to the auditory center of the brain for interpretation . 
Effects of Hazardous Noise  
Two types of hearing loss can occur when you are exposed to high intensity noise  — conductive or sensorineural (nerve -
damage).  
Conductive Hearing Loss  occurs when one of the parts of the ear that is designed to transmit mechani cal energy fails. 
For instance, a ruptured eardrum cannot transmit the sound energy to the ossicles of the middle ear. Another example of conductive hearing loss is failure of one of the middle ear bones, or the joint between the bones, to vibrate correctl y. 
Incorrect vibration causes inefficient transmission of the sound energy. Each of these examples illustrates the loss of the ability of the ear to conduct sound energy of all frequencies to the inner ear.  
Sensorineural Hearing Loss  — Occurs when the hair  cells of the cochlea are damaged, destroyed, or degenerated due 
to overexposure to noise. When a person is exposed to loud noise, the pressure waves in the cochlea are so strong that 
they can cause the base membrane of the cochlear duct to vibrate excessi vely. The excessive vibration causes the hair 
cells to brush against the upper membrane of the cochlear duct with enough force to cause damage to the hair cells. If the 
noise is intense enough or exposure long enough, the hair cells can actually be broken off. Depending on the amount of 
damage to the hair cells, you may suffer from temporary or permanent sensorineural hearing loss.  
1. Temporary threshold shift  — A nonpermanent  loss of hearing in a frequency or range of frequencies after exposure 
to loud noise. For instance, after listening to a live band, there may be a feeling of fullness in the ears accompanied by a dullness in hea ring. Additionally, there may be a ringing in the ears (tinnitus).  
When a person is exposed to loud noise, the hair cells become fatigued and sometimes damaged. Fortunately, a temporary threshold shift is not permanent. If you are exposed to noise levels t hat can cause a temporary threshold shift, sitting in a 
quiet spot for a couple of hours will usually return your hearing to almost normal. However, normal or almost normal hearing levels may not return for as much as one to two days. A crewmember who has experienced a temporary threshold 
shift should not expose their hearing to that particular noise environment again since hair cell damage has occurred and 
further damage may lead to a permanent threshold shift.  
2. Permanent threshold shift  — Occurs when the cochlea’s ability to convert a certain frequency or frequencies to 
electrical signals is lost because of hair cell damage. Once hair cells are destroyed or damaged to the point they are no longer functional, the ability to hear the affected frequencies i s permanently lost. Unfortunately, crewmembers work in 
an environment that is very hazardous to their hearing; this environment can cause permanent damage very quickly if preventive and protective measures are not taken.  
Non-Auditory Effects of Noise  — These effects o n crewmembers can pose problems in the flying environment. 
Excessive noise masks sound entering the ear and can make speech unintelligible. Masking of other crewmember’s 
speech can lead to misinterpretation of communication and cause the crew to make a mistake.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 101 
In addition to auditory masking, excessive noise increases stress. Excessive noise increases fatigue levels, leading to 
lower levels of alertness. Sleep disturbances may be encountered, leading to sleep loss and an increase in anomalies of 
attention. There is also an increase in crewmember irritability, distraction,  and uncooperativeness. In the flying 
environment where alertness, accuracy,  and attentiveness play vital roles in mission success, noise protection is important 
to keep t he crewmember safe and effective.  
Protection from Noise  
The aviation environment is noisy and can cause permanent hearing loss in crewmembers very quickly. Therefore, you 
must protect your hearing. A number of devices are available that attenuate noise and  protect hearing, including earplugs, 
ear muffs (“Mickey Mouse ears”), headsets and flight helmets. Techniques for protecting your hearing include decreasing the time of exposure and increasing your distance from the noise source.  
Earplugs  — Communication in the voice range is not disrupted or degraded when using earplugs. They protect your 
hearing by lowering the intensity of noise reaching the cochlea and by filtering the high frequencies, making speech 
reception clearer and less distorted.  
There are many types of earplugs available to the crewmember and are basically classified into two major categories  —
formable and molded plastic.  
1. Molded plastic earplugs must be fitted to the ear canal, are reusable for long periods of time, can be washed, and are 
very effective at attenuating noise. The V -51R molded earplug and a similar version, the triple -flanged earplug , are the 
most common types. Both are very effective in attenuating noise in the 2,000 Hz to 6,000 Hz range and provide fr om 24 
to 30 dB of protection at these frequencies. However, molded earplugs provide an airtight seal in the external ear canal 
and can prevent equalization of pressure during descent. Therefore, they should not be used underneath a flight helmet. 
They are most often used by ground crew personnel and crewmembers who do not wear flight helmets.  Some molded 
earplugs, however, such as the Attenuating Custom Communication Earpiece System (ACCES
®), are specifically 
designed for pilots and can be used in flight.  
2. Formable earplugs are designed to fit everyone. They are made of compressible material that expands to form -fit the 
external ear canal. One of the most popular types of formable earplug is the E -A-R® earplug made of vinyl polymer. The 
E-A-R® is compresse d by rolling it between the forefinger and thumb, and then inserting it into the ear. It should be held 
in place for approximately 20 seconds, until it has a chance to fully expand. When properly fitted, E -A-R® type earplugs 
provide roughly 25 dB protection in the 2,000 Hz to 6,000 Hz frequency range.  
To ensure maximum protection with formable earplugs, they must 
be clean and dry. Formable earplugs can be washed but will lose some of their protective capabilities. Therefore, it’s best to use a 
new pair of earplugs after one or two flights. E -A-R® earplugs are 
very popular and effective in undergraduate flying training.  
Ear Defenders, Headsets , and Flight Helmets also provide noise 
protection. The amount and effectiveness of the protection depends 
on a tight  seal between the earcup and the ear. Without a tight seal, 
sound energy can enter the ear. The effectiveness of noise protection is decreased if you wear glasses or place cloth sweat 
bands under the earcups. Sunglasses or eye glasses should be fitted 
to allow for a minimum break in the earcup seal with the ear.  
The amount of noise protection is also dependent on the mass of the helmet, earplug,  or headset being used. The lighter and less 
dense the device, the less the protection.  
Combination of Protective Devices  are the most practical protection available to you, other than limiting or preventing 
exposure to noisy environments, is the use of a combination of protective devices. Using earplugs under headsets or helmets increases the protection provided to y ou and allows for clearer radio and interphone reception. Protective devices, 
used in combination, can provide 28 – 32 dB of protection.  
Limiting Exposure  to dangerous noise levels is the best protection against hazardous noise. However, limiting exposure 
to noise is not always possible, especially if your aircraft is inherently noisy. Therefore, you must use protective devices 
to attenuate the noise. Limiting one’s exposure to loud noise environments off -duty also decreases hearing loss.

Vibration  
Vibratio n is defined as the rapid movement of an object in a back and forth motion. Vibration is described with the same 
parameters as sound  — frequency, intensity and duration.  
Frequency Ranges  
Vibrations occur throughout the frequency spectrum; however, vibration  of very low frequency and high intensity are of 
most concern. The approximate range of 1 to 100 H z is most hazardous to humans. When t he skull is exposed to vibration 
between 20 and 30 Hz , and the  eyeball between 60 and 90 Hz, t hese frequencies are partic ularly distressing to the 
individual. Vibration energy may be passed to the body acoustically or by direct mechanical linkage. Isolation of the 
vibration source and restraint of the body may be necessary to provide physiological protection.  
Effects on Perf ormance  
Low altitude, high speed flight in weather causes the most severe vibration exposures. Vibration can affect your ability to perform at peak levels.  
Tracking  can be affected, horizontal tracking is generally not affected by vibration. However, vertical tracking is 
significantly impaired with vibration. Low frequency vibrations can produce tracking error up to 40 percent greater than in an environment without vibration.  
Reaction Time of executing tasks delegated to the subconscious level showed marked  deterioration during vibration.  
However, studies indicate that vibration does not typically influence crewmember reaction time to tasks executed at the 
conscious level.  
Visual Impairment  can be caused by vibration.  It can cause blurred vision and therefor e reduce your visual efficiency. 
Vibration in the frequency band ranges of 25 to 40 and 60 to 90 Hz are particularly degrading to visual acuity. Vibration 
causing blurring of the instrument panel makes accurate reading of the instruments very difficult. Pr oper design of visual 
instruments and displays and an increase in their illumination and contrast reduces the effect of the vibration.  
Fatigue  — Vibration contributes to fatigue, a prime factor in decreased crewmember performance.  
Symptoms of Exposure  
Symptoms which may result from exposure to harmful vibration frequencies are loss of appetite, complacency, 
perspiration, salivation, nause a, headache,  and vomiting. Severe vibration can also result in fatigue, discomfort, and 
actual pain. There is indication that long -term vibratory exposures can lead to chronic stiffness of articulating joints and 
appear to develop in much the same manner as noise -induced hearing loss.  
Summary  
The noise and vibration produced by the aircraft is one of the many stresses you must cope with while flying. Noise is 
simply defined as unwanted sound and can become a problem to you as a result of the noise’s frequen cy, intensity,  or 
duration. The process of perceiving sound involves the conversion of the mechanical sound wave to electrical energy that can be interpreted by the brain. Proper protection from hazardous noise is most effectively accomplished through the use 
of a combination of devices in order to minimize the possibility of hearing loss or other non- auditory effects of noise. 
Finally, the hazard of vibration is greatest at a low frequency and high intensity. These hazards include effects on 
performance su ch as imp aired vertical tracking, degrad ed reaction time, visual impairment, and fatigue as well as causing 
physical symptoms.

Introduction 
As we stated before, the crewmember, rather than aircraft design, is the limiting factor in military flying. You face more 
physiological threats of greater degree than ever before. Modern fighter aircraft  routinely operate in a high -G environment  
— a high sortie rate and sustained operations is the “norm.” Therefore, you must be in excellent physical and mental 
condition to perform your duties, whether in training or in combat.  
An understanding of acceleration on the human body is important to your in- flight performance because of its effects on 
the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and vestibular (orientation) systems. The ability to overcome the effects of acceleration 
will become more important as you are expos ed to aircraft with greater maneuverability and performance. Your ability 
to combat the adverse effects of G forces depends directly on your level of physical condition and your ability to reduce negative life stressors.  
Note  — After the classroom presentation, you will demonstrate the AGSM to the satisfaction of your instructor.  
Information  
Before G forces are discussed in depth, we will define several terms so you can understand acceleration and how G forces 
are generated.  
Physical Principles and Types  
Physical Principles  
Speed — Rate of motion (or how far) one travels in a certain amount of time, irrespective of direction. An example is 
flying at 360 knots groundspeed.  
Velocity  — Describes both a rate of motion (speed) and direction of travel. An example of velocity is 360 knots 
groundspeed on a heading of 180 degrees.  
Acceleration  — The change in velocity per unit time and is generally expressed in feet per second per second (ft/sec2) 
or meters per second per second (m/sec2). Acceleration is produced when either speed, direction (or both) change.  
The most familiar type of acceleration is gravity. Gravity affects anything on or near the Earth. The acceleration produced 
by gravity (g) is a constant with a value of 32 ft/sec2 or 9.8 m/sec2. Therefore, a free- falling body will increase its velocity 
by 32 ft/sec or 9.8 m/sec for every second it falls. The inertial force resulting from the linear acceleration of gravity act ing 
upon a mass is termed 1 G. Therefore, when we discuss G forces in the flying environment, we are referring to the inertial 
force resulting from acceleration.  
Types of Acceleration  
Linear  Acceleration  — A change in speed (increase or decrease) without a change in direct ion (Figure 11- 1). This 
reflects a change o f speed in a straight line. This type of acceleration  occurs during take -off, landing, or in level flight 
when a throttle setting is changed . 
 
Figure 11 -1 — Linear Acceleration  
 
 
  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 107 
Radial Acceleration  — A change in direction without a change in speed (Fig ure 11 -2). Radial acceleration occurs when 
an aircraft pulls out of a dive, pushes over into a dive, or performs an inside or outside turn (and does not change its 
speed). In these examples, the aircraft’s direction changes, but the airspeed remains the sa me. 
 
Figure 11 -2 — Radial Acceleration  
Angular  Acceleration  — A simultaneous change in both speed and direction (Figure 11- 3). Angular acceleration occurs 
during most aerial maneuvers. For instance, when an aircraft performs a split -S maneuver, the aircraft’s speed and 
direction change simultaneously and the crew experiences angular acceleration.  
 
Figure 11 -3 — Angular Acceleration  
G Forces  
As an aircraft accelerates in one direction, inertial forces act on your body in the opposite direction of the appli ed force. 
The inertial force causes the body to experience a G force. The following section discusses the types of G forces a crewmember experiences and the physical factors influencing the effects of G forces on the body.  
Types of G Forces  
The direction o f force determines the type of G force you experience. Three types of G forces you can experience are 
discussed. They are transverse G, negative G, and positive G.  
Transverse G Force — The force applied to the front (+G
x) or back ( -Gx) of the body (Figure 11- 4). +G x and -Gx forces 
are normally encountered during takeoffs, acceleration in level flight, and landing. The maximum transverse G tolerable to humans is roughly 15 Gs in the +G
x direction and about 8 Gs in the -Gx direction. Catapult shots from a carrier deck 
would be a good example of +G x and Carrier landings a good example of -Gx. 
Note  — Lateral G forces (the G y direction) are experienced during spin or roll; however, the effects are negligible.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 108 
 
Figure 11 -4 — Transverse G Force  
Negative G Force — Defined as the force being applied from the feet towards the head and is expressed as - Gz (Figure 
11-5). Negative G force is not tolerated well by humans and is seldom experienced in  high levels during normal flight. 
Normally, -Gz is experienced when the nose of the aircraft is lowered during a “pushover” or when experiencing 
turbulence. Human tolerance (physical discomfort) to - Gz may be as low as 3 Gs for 5 seconds.  
 
Figure 11 -5 — Negative G Force 
The physical symptoms of -Gz are a sense of weightlessness, congestion in the head and face, headache and visual 
blurring. Some flyers have reported a phenomenon called “redout,” a reddening of vision during sustained negative G z 
flight. T he causes of redout  are not completely understood. The progressive effects of - Gz are illustrated in Figure 11 -6. 
 
Figure 11 -6 — Effects of Negative Acceleration  
There is no practical method to counteract the effects of -Gz. Under normal conditions, the o nly way to combat the effects 
of -Gz is to reduce aircraft maneuvering and return to a 1 G environment.  
Positive G Force — A force applied from the head towards the feet. It is expressed as +G z. It occurs during turns and 
dive recoveries and is the G force most often experienced by crewmembers. Therefore, much of the remaining 
information deals with the physiological effects and symptoms of +G z and methods to increase one’s tolerance to +G z. 
Crewmembers’ average resting tolerance to +G z is 5.5 G. The averag e levels and the progressive effects of +G z are 
illustrated in Figure 11 -7.

UNCLASSIFIED 109 
  
Figure 11 -7 — Effects of Positive Acceleration  
Factors Determining the Effects of G Forces  
Physical Considerations  
The five factors (or physical considerations) determining the effects of G forces are discussed below. These factors help 
explain why certain G forces h ave different effects on the body and why the body reacts to certain types of G forces in 
different situations. Some of these factors are interrelated and have a combined effect on the crewmember.  
Magnitude of the G Force  is the size of G force applied to the body. The greater the magnitude of acceleration and 
accompanying inertial force, the greater the G force. For instance, a crewmember pulling +6 G z is being accelerated to 
six times the gravitational force of the Earth, or 192 ft/sec2. Modern fighter ai rcraft, like the F -18 and F -16, are capable 
of exposing you to sustained eight to nine Gs.  
Duration of Exposure to the G Force  is another determinant  of the effects of the G force on the body. For example, 
jumping from a table one me ter high results in a d eceleration  force of about 14 Gs for a fraction of a second, usually with 
no ill effects. But, being exposed to 14 Gs for over two seconds will result in significant physical and physiological 
effects. These effects are further discussed later in the lesso n. The T -6 does not maintain a high sustained G load due to 
excessive energy loss.  
Rate of Application (G onset)  directly influences the effect of a G force. Rate of G force application is expressed in G 
per second (G/sec). To illustrate the effect of G on set, imagine dropping a brick on someone’s foot versus placing a brick 
of identical mass on the person’s foot. The dropped brick has a greater physical effect on the foot than the brick placed, 
even though both bricks are identical in mass. The difference is in the rate of acceleration and the resultant inertial force.  
Aircraft with long, straight, rectangular wing platforms like the T -6 typ ically have rapid G onset rates . The T -37, for 
example,  had the highest G o nset rate in the USAF inventory. The average time to a visual symptom (grayout) of +G z 
exposure is determined by the rate of G onset. The slower the onset, the longer the time to grayout in the low to moderate G ranges.   
Direction of Force defines the axis of the body the G force is applied. The G  
force can be applied through the X, Y,  or Z axis of the body (Figure 11- 8). By 
determining the direction of the force, the type of G can be identified. For instance, a force applied from the head towards the feet is a +G
z force and a 
force applied from th e feet towards the head is a - Gz force. G forces can be 
experienced along other axes as well, but the force applied along the +Z axis has the most significant effect on crewmember performance.  
Previous G Exposure  — The Push- Pull Effect (PPE) is a phenomenon of 
reduced +G
z tolerance when preceded by exposure to Gz that is less than +1 
Gz. It is thought that the less than +1G z exposure causes a cardiovascular 
relaxation which can affect subsequent  +G z tolerance. -Gz exposure for a 
duration of less than 2 seconds can significantly affect +G z tolerance, possibly 
reducing tolerance by up to 1.5 Gs (dependent upon magnitude and duration 
of the -Gz exposure). Maneuvers that produce the PPE are found in some 
training aerobatics and tactics which include dive attacks, extensions, air 
combat maneuvering guns defense and split -s maneuvers.  
Figure 11 -8 — X, Y, and Z Axes  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 110 
Another aspect of previous G exposure is the fact that the body can be prompted to prepare for increased Gs. The G -
warm -up is a maneuver you will fly at the beginning of most sorties. The G -warm -up consists of a very controlled 
exposure to increased G whi ch prepares you for the higher G  follow -on maneuvers. You will be briefed on the specific 
procedures of the G -warm -up man euver before your first high -G sortie.  
Note  — An accelerometer (G -meter) monitors G forces during flight. It displays instantaneous G, maximum positive G, 
and maximum negative G. The dial also indicates the maximum permissible G force the aircraft can sustain, both positive 
and negative.  
Physiologi cal Effects and Symptoms  
Prolonged exposure to G forces affects the body in four principle ways  — restricting mobility, affecting the 
cardiovascular system, stimulating the vestibular system, and reducing visual acuity.  
Mobility  — A 150 pound crewmember we ighs 600 pounds when exposed to +4 G z. This increase in weight severely 
restricts movement in the aircraft. For example, your head weighs about 29 pounds when wearing a helmet and oxygen mask. At +4 G
z, your head weighs approximately 116 pounds. If you are  not prepared, this increased weight could force 
your chin into your chest when a loop is initiated. Combined with other physiological effects of +G z, decreased mobility 
interferes with your ability to function at peak levels during high -G flight.  
Cardiovascular Reflex  — As +G z forces 
increase, cranial blood pressure begins to 
decrease. Each +G z drops blood pressure 
approximately 22 mmHg. The cardiovascular 
system attempts to compensate for the drop in 
blood pressure by constricting peripheral blood 
vessel s and increasing the heart rate. This 
compensation is known as the cardiovascular reflex . The G -time tolerance curve (Figure 11-
9) represents an extremely important concept 
regarding physiological reactions to +G
z.  
1. Yellow Line  — The eyes and brain cont ain 
sufficient oxygen to maintain vision and 
consciousness for 4 -5 seconds after blood stops 
flowing to the head.  Here , a high +G z load is  
applied very rapidly for a short duration without 
experiencing visual symptoms ( e.g., yanking the 
stick suddenly as d uring a threat avoidance 
maneuver ). 
2. Green Line — Illustrates  the severe danger of rapidly -applied, sustained G loads. The first several seconds of such 
a G load is symptom free because of the oxygen reserve in the eye and brain. However, as blood in the eyes and brain is 
depleted of the oxygen reserve, G -induced loss of consciousness (G -LOC) occurs. In this situation, there is essentially 
no warning from visual symptoms (grayout, tunnel vision, blackout, etc.) to indicate imminent G -LOC.  For example, 
crewmembers expecting to pull a rapidly -applied 9 G load until grayout (and then unload if necessary), would almost 
certainly experience G -LOC.  
3. Magenta Line — Between 5 and 10 seconds, when the oxygen reserve is depleted and the cardiovascular reflex has 
not become fully effective, a trough occurs in the curve  — G tolerance is at its lowest. Applying +G z at a moderate rate, 
cause s symptoms of G stress  at a lower +G z level than when Gs are appli ed more rapidly or more slowly, which results 
in G-LOC.  
4. Blue Line — The cardiovascular reflexes mobilize after about 10 seconds of +G z stress. This reflex increases blood 
flow to the head, increasing G tolerance by about 1 G. Therefore, when the +G z load is applied slowly, this reflex helps 
G tolerance and leads to visual symptoms  without G -LOC . 
Vestibular  effects and their symptoms play a critical role in spatial disorientation and balance. The otoliths are stimulated 
by gravity and linear acceleration forces to provide you a sense of direction. The semicircular can als respond to angular 
acceleration to provide another sense of direction. If you do not rely on your instruments and visual cues, acceleration 
forces can provide stimuli that induce disorientation.   
Figure 11 -9 — G-Time Tolerance Curve 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 111 
Visual  — For blood to enter the retina, the cardiovascular system must overcome about 13 – 18 mm Hg of intraocular 
pressure. As the G forces increase and the blood pressure in the brain begins to drop, there is insufficient blood pressure 
to overcome the intraocular pressure. Therefore, the tissue in the eye that detects light (retina) starts losing its blood 
supply.  
As the blood supply is decreased, peripheral vision is affected and you experience a dimming, misting, or graying of your 
vision referred to as grayout  or you may experience tunnel vision, where the only vision remaining is in the center of 
your visual field. At this point, you must perform a more intense anti -G straining maneuver (AGSM) or unload the Gs 
immediately. (Exactly how you perform an effective AGSM will be discussed in subsequent paragraphs .) As the G force 
increases, the blood pressure drops to where it cannot overcome the intraocular pressure and all vision is lost, referred to 
as blackout . It is important to note that blackout does not mean you are unconscious . However, you are in imminent 
danger of G -LOC.  
Note  — With high G onset rates, unconsciousness can happen without any preceding visual cues, so always load up the 
body with an effective AGSM before you load up the aircraft.  
G-Induced Loss of Consciousness  
The brain has a 4 to 5 second oxygen reserve. Once blood flow ceases and the oxygen reserve is used, unconsciousness 
(G-LOC) results. The AGSM sustains blood flow during this critical period of G onset. The effects of G -LOC are 
described as two phases of incapacitation  — absolute  and relative . 
Absolute Inc apacitation  
In absolute incapacitation you are actually unconscious for roughly 9 to 21 seconds, with an average time of 15 seconds. 
When you become unconscious, you could relax your grip on the flight controls and the aircraft could return to 1 G flight. 
If you return to 1 G flight, the cardiovascular system is able to pump blood to the brain and consciousness is restored. 
However, you could also maintain your grip on the flight controls and perhaps fly the aircraft into the ground.  
During the latter stage s of absolute incapacitation, you may experience marked involuntary skeletal muscle contractions 
and spasms just before regaining consciousness. These contractions can cause your arms to flail, leave the flight controls, or hit other aircraft controls. Onc e you regain consciousness, you enter the second phase of incapacitation.  
Relative Incapacitation  
Unfortunately, when you regain consciousness, you do not instantly return to an alert and functional state. You may experience mental confusion, disorientatio n, stupor, apathy, or memory loss. During this time, you are incapable of 
consciously flying the aircraft, making decisions, taking action against a threat, or communicating effectively. The time of relative incapacitation usually mirrors that of the absolute incapacitation.  
Protection  Against Positive G Force  
The human body has a limited ability to compensate for the effects of G force. However, there are effective artificial methods you can use to increase your G tolerance and protect against G -LOC.  
Prote ction Methods  
Anti -G Suit,  sometimes referred to as a G -suit consists of a pair of pant -like covers fitting tightly over your legs  and 
lower abdomen. Air bladders in the thigh, calf,  and abdomen areas of the suit are automatically inflated by an anti -G 
valve on the aircraft. However, the G -suit is not the primary means of G -LOC protection and used by itself, only allows 
for 1 to 1.5 G of protection. Your primary defense against G -LOC is a properly executed A GSM. The T -6 is equipped 
with a G -suit; however, i t does not provide the majority of the protection from G -LOC.  
Anti -G Straining Maneuver  
There are two  components  of the AGSM  — lower mu scle straining and the  cyclic air exchange  technique.  
1. Muscle tensing is the forceful contraction of leg s, buttocks, and abdominal muscles to compress the blood vessels in 
the lower body. This skeletal muscle tensing helps prevent pooling of blood in the abdomen and lower extremities and 
improves the circulation of blood back to the heart (in a high +G
z environment, blood will naturally pool anywhere below 
the heart). Muscle tensing is mandatory every time you pull Gs and the intens ity should be in proportion to the G -load 
experienced.  
In today’s high performance combat aircraft and trainers, skeletal muscle tensing alone is not effective enough protection 
against G -LOC. Therefore, a second element of cyclic air exchanges  is used in conjunction with muscle tensing. The 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 112 
increased chest pressure compresses the heart and blood vessels in the chest cavity and provides an artificial pumping 
action that, in turn, raises blood pressure in the head. As a result, blood flow to the eyes and bra in is maintained during 
G stress.  
2. Cyclic air exchanges begin with a calm prep breath  (normal inhalation ) while engaging the abdominal muscles at 
the same time . The breath is held at the glottis and the chest pressure must be maintained for approximately  3.0 (±0.5) 
seconds, broken only by a rapid air exchange (exhalation and inhalation) of no more than 0.5 second duration. The initial 
inspiration is performed after the muscles are tensed and before the G level is increased above 1G. Cyclic air exchanges  
must be accomplished simultaneously with muscle tensing. In a high G environment, failure to maintain mus cle tension 
during the air exchange  element increases the amount of blood pooling in the lower extremities and deprives the heart of 
necessary blood pre ssure. The rapid air exchange reduces intrathoracic pressure and enhances venous return thereby 
improving cardiac output and head level blood pressure.  
AGSM Performance  
Muscle Tensing  is needed to be totally effective and prevent G -LOC, begin the AGSM prio r to G onset. It’s especi ally 
important to tense the calves , thigh, buttocks,  and abdominal muscles; these muscles are below the heart and have the 
greatest effect  on preventing pooling of blood in the lower extremities. When tightening the abdominal muscl es, it should 
not be a crunching of the core but more of an “abs out” method, like bracing for a punch to the stomach or stabilizing 
ones core against a weight belt. Maintain  the muscle tension until the aircraft returns to 1 G flight.  
The muscle tensing e lement of the AGSM may be sufficient to maintain consciousness in the lower G environments. 
However, preventing blood pooling in the lower extremities and abdomen by muscle tensing can be overcome by a subtle 
increase in the G force. The increased G force can cause visual disturbances and/or G -LOC. Therefore, crewmembers 
should perform all elements of the AGSM and then back off their strain as needed. It’s better to strain too much then ease up, than to strain too little and not be able to catch up. A prope rly performed AGSM can raise tolerance to G by 4 Gs.  
Cyclic Air Exchanges  are air exchanges  in 3 second cycles to maintain optimum chest pressure, maximize venous return 
to the heart and oxygen flow into the lungs. If the air exchange cycle is too rapid th en the chest pressure is not adequately 
maintained, fatigue sets in, and there is a threat of hyperventilation. Conversely, if the cycle is too long then the chest 
pressure remains too high and venous return to the heart is restricted. This restriction dec reases the blood available to be 
pumped by the heart to the eyes and brain.  
Other keys to the AGSM are the timing of the air exchange cycle and, importantly, anticipating the G forces in order to 
increase blood pressure in the head. With time and experien ce, performing the AGSM becomes easier and more natural. 
In the beginning, the problems crewmembers have with the AGSM mostly relate to the breathing cycle and leading the 
G force.  
Note  — The goal must be to employ the AGSM as a subconscious partner to G -onset, thereby freeing up conscious 
attention to focus on other aspects of flying. This  can only be accomplished with persistent repetition.  
Common  Errors of Performance 
The most common cause of G -LOC is an improperly performed AGSM . The most common errors involve the breathing 
cycle, the timing of the strain, loss of situational awareness, and insufficient lower body muscle tensing.  
Timing  — The primary timing error is starting the AGSM after the onset of the G force. Starting the strain late occurs 
more often if you are not at the controls of the aircraft. You may not be aware the pilot is about to perform a high -G 
maneuver. Experience wil l help overcome this disadvantage. The key to preventing this error is good crew coordination 
and communication. Anticipate the G onset and start the AGSM before the G force is encountered.  
Note  — If you are aware of potential G onset and perform an effect ive straining maneuver, you will decrease the chance 
of grayout, blackout, and most importantly G -LOC. If you are not flying the aircraft, your chance of experiencing G -
LOC is greater than the crewmember flying the aircraft.  
Another timing error is the fai lure to maintain the AGSM until the aircraft has returned to 1 G flight. Crewmembers sense 
the G force decreasing and relax. Unfortunately, there is still sufficient G force remaining to force the blood from the 
brain and cause G -LOC. Remember, maintain th e AGSM until the aircraft returns to a 1 G flight environment.  
Breathing  — For inexperienced crewmembers, one of the more difficult aspects of the AGSM is the coordination and 
timing of cyclic air exchanges . These problems are readily corrected with practice and experience.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 113 
Common breathing errors include holding the breath to o long, not hol ding the breath long enough (e.g ., 2 second cycle), 
taking too much time to exchange air, exchanging too much air, and failure to exchange air at all. The primary method 
of correcting these errors is to p ractice and establish a rhythm.  
Taking too much time to exchange the air or exchanging too much air causes the chest pressure to drop and decreases 
blood flow to the brain.  
Failing to exchange air occurs when you have a good lung- full of air and are tensing the skeletal muscles properly, but 
forget to exhale and try to continue inhaling. Unfortunately, you can only put so much air into your lungs; there must be an exchange. This error eventually leads to decreased venous return to the heart and stagnant blood flow, resulting in G -
LOC.  
A final error associated with breathing is the relaxation of the lower body strain during the air exchange. If the lower body strain is not maintained during the air exchange, excessive blood pooling will occur.  
Loss of Situational Awareness  — Often times an improperly performed, late, or absent AGSM is because of a loss of 
situational awareness. Individuals channelize their attention, are task saturated, or misprioritize tasks to the detriment of  
performing an effective AGSM. Student inexper ience makes them more susceptible to these attention management 
problems. Combined with the high- G onset rate of most trainers, this student susceptibility to loss of situational awareness 
causes trainer aircraft to have much higher G -LOC rates than operat ional aircraft. Fortunately, most, but not all, of the 
G-LOCs that occur in trainer aircraft happen during dual sorties, allowing the IP to recover the aircraft. Students must 
work to constantly maintain situational awareness to ensure a timely and proper AGSM whether they are flying the 
aircraft or not.  
Other Errors  — Allowing air to leak from the throat, holding the breath in the mouth instead of catching it in the back 
of the throat, and insufficient muscle strain are additional errors in performing the AGSM. Allowing air to leak past the 
glottis causes the pressure in the chest to drop. It also irritates the vocal cords and makes communication difficult. Air 
leakage is evidenced by a groan when you strain.  
Insufficient muscle strain allows too much bloo d into the lower extremities. This most common error of not maintaining 
lower body leg tension causes vision loss. Development of muscle strength and tone with an anaerobic exercise program will remedy this error.  
Waiting for the G -suit to inflate before executing the strain is another common mistake. By the time the G -suit is inflated 
a substantial volume of blood is pooled in the legs and will be lost to free circulation until you return to 1 G flight. You must begin the strain before  you load up the air craft!  
Tolerance to Positive G Force  
G tolerance changes from day to day and hour to hour based on a number of variables. Understanding the reasons for these variables helps you maximize your tolerance and minimize the threat of G -LOC. The following sectio n describes 
some of the physiological factors and their effects on G tolerance.  
Physiological Factors  
Physical Conditioning  — Mentioned previously as a method to improve muscle strain during the AGSM. Physical 
conditioning is also important in decreasing the fatigue levels and increasing stamina required for multiple G maneuvers. Two types of physical conditioning are encourag ed — anaerobic and aerobic.  
Anaerobic Conditioning  — The AGSM is essentially an anaerobic maneuver. The muscles used to perform the AGSM 
rely upon anaerobic energy sources (energy sources not requiring oxygen). Crewmembers flying high performance 
aircraft are encouraged to develop a weight training program to maximize their muscle strain ability. Weight training is 
the primary method of anaerobic conditioning and decreases your chances of injury, particularly neck injury during high-
G maneuvers.  
Anaerobic conditioning increases the muscle’s ability to contract and sustain the contraction throughout the G stress. 
Without sufficient anaerobic conditioning the muscles fatigue quickly and your AGSM loses its efficiency. However, 
developing a conditioning program  based solely on anaerobic exercise is not complete. Aerobic conditioning must 
complement your anaerobic conditioning.  
Aerobic Conditioning  — Even though the AGSM is primarily an anaerobic maneuver, you need to be aerobically fit to 
combat fatigue and reco ver from multiple G maneuvers. Aerobic exercise programs require oxygen to produce the 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 114 
necessary energy. Aerobic conditioning increases stamina and resistance to fatigue. (G -LOC typically occurs towards the 
end of engagements during the fatigue period.)  
Overall, for crewmembers that fly in high performance aircraft, a sound anaerobic training program coupled with a 
sensible aerobic exercise program will help maximize their G  tolerance. However, exercising prior to high G flight  
without proper recovery time,  may leave you in a fatigued and dehydrated state and is not recommended.  
The Role of Self -Imposed Stress  
Dehydration  — Crewmembers generally drink less water than they need and are slightly dehydrated most of the time. 
Dehydration reduces G -performance markedly by depleting blood plasma volume. Aircrews must drink plenty of non-
caffeinated, nonalcoholic fluids (even when not thirsty) prior to (and during) flight. You suffer a 35 percent decrease in 
ability to do anaerobic work and a 20 percent decrease in ability to do aerobic work if you are 3 percent dehydrated. 
Therefore, you can only maintain an AGSM for one- half the time you normally would. For instance, if you can normally 
pull 9 Gs for 10 seconds, the effects of dehydration will limit you to 9 Gs for  5 seconds.  
Fatigue and Sleep — Fatigue significantly decreases G tolerance. Crewmembers that are fatigued or are lacking sleep 
tend to experience lapses in mental function and a lower ability to maintain muscle tension during the AGSM.  
Mental fatigue slow s your response and anticipation of high G maneuvers. Physical fatigue lowers your capability to 
maintain adequate muscle strain during the AGSM and also lowers your capability to perform subsequent strains.  
Take advantage of your crew rest, stay well rest ed, and maintain good sleep patterns prior to flying.  
Drugs and Self -medication  — Self-medication with over -the-counter drugs can potentially decrease overall 
performance. You must always perform at peak levels in a high G environment. Do not self -medicate, report to the flight 
surgeon and obtain qualified medical treatment.  
Alcohol/Hangover  — Alcohol misuse, and the accompanying hangover , drastically reduce your G tolerance. The 
reduced G tolerance is primarily due to alcohol’s dehydrating effects. In addition, a hangover clouds your mental capabilities, slows the thinking and decision- making process, as well as your ability to effectively judge situations.  
Alcohol use should  be avoided prior to flight. AFMAN  11-202, Volume 3 restricts crewmembers from alcohol 
consumption 12 hours prior to flight. In addition, some detrimental afteref fects can last as long as 48 to 72 hours. Alcohol 
also contributes to fatigue and hypoglycemia.  
Hypoglycemia and Missed Meals  — Missing meals or not taking the time to eat correctly directly affects your ability 
to withstand increased G force. You do not have the fuel in your system to maintain high levels of activity for extended periods of time if you do not eat or you eat improperly. Take the time to eat a nutritious meal prior to flight. Your food 
is the fuel you must rely on to function in a high G environment.  
Summary  
G forces are the result of inertial forces acting on the body. G is a dimensionless number expressed as a r atio of a body’s 
acceleration to the force of gravity (32 ft/sec2 or 9.81 m/sec2). 
The magnitude, duration of exposure, rate of application, direction of force applied and previous G exposure are physical 
factors influencing the body’s physiological respon se to a G force. These factors define the G force and can predict the 
effect the G force will have on you.  
+G z is the force of greatest concern to you. It is regularly encountered in -flight. The effects of +G z are decreased mobility, 
visual disturbances li ke grayout and blackout, and finally G -LOC. You can increase your tolerance to +G z by correctly 
performing the AGSM.  
The AGSM is performed by tensing the skeletal muscles (particularly in the lower extremities and the abdomen), cyclic air exchanges  and a closed glottis. Start the AGSM prior to G onset and do not stop the AGSM until the aircraft returns 
to 1 G flight.  
Physiological factors will increase or decrease your G tolerance. These factors include your physical condition and self -
imposed stresses (fat igue, dehydration, self -medication, alcohol use,  and nutrition). Staying in shape, avoiding self -
imposed stresses, and performing an effective AGSM will help increase your G tolerance.

Introduction 
In military aviation, a su bstantial percentage of Class A mishaps are attributed to human error . The self -imposed stresses 
discussed in this lesson are directly linked to human errors.  
Self-imposed stresses decrease your capability to function in high stress environments where phys ical and mental 
capabilities must be optimal. Figure 12 -1 (Critical Interface Concept) illustrates the compounding effects of self -imposed 
stresses, attention problems, environmental stresses, and aircraft problems on an aircrew’s capacity to cope with nor mal 
flight stresses. Line A of the model contains the stresses most within your control. Line B of the model depicts 
environmental stresses beyond the crewmember’s control. For the most part, environmental stresses are based on the type 
of aircraft flown, time of day the mission is flown and mission profile. However, unpredictable stresses, like weather or 
mechanical problems, are also included in environmental stresses. The area between lines A and B represent the 
crewmember’s capacity to cope with any unk nown stress the aircraft or mission places on them.  
Your capacity to cope is decreased by self -imposed stresses like alcohol misuse or self -medicating with over -the-counter 
(OTC) drugs. This decrease in capacity to handle stress is depicted by a dip in lin e A of Figure 12 -1. The more stresses 
you subject yourself to, the more you decrease your capacity to cope. If environmental stresses increase to the point 
where the capacity to cope and environmental demands intersect (critical interface), you lose the capability to effectively 
cope with the flight situation. In most mishaps, there is seldom just one major factor causing the mishap. Instead, mishaps 
usually occur when many small factors add up to disrupt the crew’s capacity to fly the aircraft.

Therefore, you must understand the importance of decreasing your exposure to self -imposed stress. The closer you are 
to 100 percent capable, the greater your ability to cope with unexpected problems or stresses arising durin g flight.  
Self-imposed stresses result from actions taken by the crewmember. They can include the use of OTC drugs, caffeine, 
alcohol,  or tobacco. Self -imposed stresses also include nutrition, physical condition,  and life -style. These stresses, as well 
as circadian rhythm problems, can contribute to fatigue. All of these stresses strain your ability to function at an optimum 
level in the aircraft. Self -imposed stresses decrease your performance, impair your judgment, and decrease your tolerance 
to other in -flight stresses.  
Self-Medication  
Use of Over- The-Counter (OTC) Drugs  
In the civilian world, a person who catches a cold, comes down with the flu,  or physically feels bad, can take one of the 
many OTC drugs available. Aircrew members will not normally self -medicate. Air Force regulations (AFMAN  11-202, 
Volume 3, Flight Operations , and AFI 48 -123, Medical Examinations and Standards ) contain directives on the use of 
OTC drugs (“self -medicating”) or flying while under the influence of medications.  
Nonprescript ion medications are designed to alleviate the symptoms of an 
illness without treating the cause of the illness. Therefore, OTC drugs only 
mask the sym ptoms to make you feel better and the masking of symptoms 
may delay treatment of a medical problem. The negative effects and the 
various types of OTC drugs are discussed in the following sections. Figure 
12-2 lists common OTC drugs misused by crewmembers.  
Effects of OTC Drugs  
OTC drugs interfere with or modify normal body functions in different ways. The effects of OTC drugs are divided into primary, side, synergistic and 
idiosyncratic effects . 
Primary Effect  of each type of drug is the desired (intended) effect of the drug on the individual. For instance, a person 
takes an OTC decongestant because they are con gested. The primary effect of a decongestant is to dry up the nasal 
passages and sinuses.  
Side Effects  are those effects known to accompany a drug but are additional to its desired effect. For example, the person 
who takes a decongestant to clear up their sinuses may also experience the side effects of increased heart rate and blurred vision.  
Synergistic Effects o ccur when the primary or side effect of a drug is modified in function or intensity when taken in 
combination with another drug. The effect of the  combined drugs is greater than would be expected from the individual 
drugs (in a synergistic reaction the sum of the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, or 1+1 = 3). For example, combining a decongestant with caffeine increases the stimulant effect above the normally expected level.  
Idiosyncratic Effects  are those effects on an individual that are unusual and unexpected. Just as certain individuals have 
unexpected allergic reactions to types of food, people may have unexpected adverse reactions to types of drugs. Although rare, a crewmember self -medicating with an OTC drug may experience an unexpected reaction to the drug.  
Decongestants  are normally found in “cold -remedies” and act as a stimulant. Decongestants are used to shrink inflamed 
mucous mem branes and clear up a person’s nasal passages and sinuses. OTC decongestant medications may contain only 
a decongestant. However, other medications may contain antihistamines and pain killers in combination with the 
decongestant.  
The side effects of decong estants are detrimental to crewmembers. Decongestants can produce shakiness, increased heart 
rate, blurred vision, increased dehydration, dizziness, nausea,  and headaches. Therefore, self -medicating with 
decongestants increases your physiological stress le vels and decreases your capacity to cope.  
Antihistamines are u sed to reduce nasal congestion due to allergies and colds. They are normally found in OTC drugs 
combined with other compounds such as decongestants. Common OTC cold remedy drugs contain both ant ihistamines 
and decongestants. Antihistamines relieve congestion by blocking the release of histamine  — responsible for the swelling 
of the nasal mucous membranes in an allergic reaction. The result is a decrease in mucous production and possible relief 
from the itching and watering of the eyes.   
Figure 12 -2 — Types of OTC 
Drugs  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 121 
Antihistamines’ undesirable side effect is the depressant nature they have on the central nervous system (CNS). 
Drowsiness is the most common effect, but they also cause diminished alertness and increased reaction t imes. If alcohol 
or other CNS depressants are also consumed, a synergistic effect occurs, increasing the depressant effect of antihistamines. The danger of a mishap is greatly increased. This synergistic effect is particularly pronounced if you take an OTC  drug high in alcohol. These OTC drugs usually contain both an antihistamine and up to 25 percent alcohol (50 
proof). Idiosyncratic effects may include dizziness, muscular incoordination, nervousness,  and tremors.  
Vasoconstrictors can be t opical drugs spra yed in the nose (nasal sprays). They act to constrict blood vessels in the nose 
and sinuses, resulting in a reduction of inflammation and swelling. The dangers of using these drugs, without being under 
the supervision of a flight surgeon, are twofold. Dizz iness, blurred vision, tremors,  and headaches may occur if a 
vasoconstrictor is used prior to flight. There is also the chance of the medication wearing off prior to descent and landing,  
allowing the tissues to swell and increasing the chance of blocked si nuses or ears. The second danger with 
vasoconstrictors occurs after prolonged use (roughly three days) when the nasal tissues become addicted to the drug. If 
vasoconstrictor use is discontinued after the tissues are addicted, the tissues increase mucous pr oduction. The resulting 
congestion is usually much worse than the original case of congestion. Additionally, extended use can deteriorate the 
nasal mucosa.  
Pain Killers (Analgesics) are u sed by most everyone. Primary OTC pain killers are aspirin or acetami nophen (Tylenol® 
or Naproxen ®). Aspirin is used to relieve mild pain or headache and to relieve fever. Aspirin and acetaminophen can 
cause stomach irritation as a side effect. Ibuprofen is a third type of OTC pain killer. Unfortunately, the side effects ar e 
more serious than with aspirin or acetaminophen. Side effects may include dizziness, skin rash, heartburn, gastrointestinal 
disturbances,  and blurred vision.  
Diet Pills  contain the same medications found in decongestants. They are stimulants with unwant ed side effects. 
Including nervousness, tremors, increased blood pressure and heart rate, dehydration due to increased sweating, and sleep disturbances. There is a significant synergistic effect when diet pills are used in conjunction with caffeine. This effect includes a marked increase in blood pressure and increased dehydration.  
If you feel a need to lose weight, you can do so without diet pills. A sensible diet and a regular exercise program is a much healthier and safer alternative for losing weight.  
In summary, do not self -medicate. If you are ill, consult a flight surgeon and don’t fly.  
Alcohol and Tobacco Use  
Alcohol  
Perhaps the oldest drug known to man, alcohol is a legal drug having toxic effects on the body. It is a central nervous system depressa nt. Alcohol is absorbed through the stomach and upper tract of the small intestine and distributed 
throughout the body by the circulatory system. The concentration of alcohol in the brain and nervous tissues rapidly 
approaches the same concentration as in the blood because of the extensive blood flow through these tissues. As the 
alcohol reaches the tissues, it’s absorbed by the cells and causes histotoxic hypoxia by disrupting cellular metabolism.  
Short -Term Effects  are a result of the histotoxic effects o f alcohol on the brain and nervous tissues, higher brain function 
is impaired. Marked psychological reactions are experienced, the most common being the impairment of judgment and performance, reduction of inhibitions, abnormal behavioral shifts, and a bol stered sense of immortality. Physiologically, 
the crewmember becomes anesthetized, suffers degraded sensory and motor skills, decreased visual acuity, degraded 
communication ability and loss of balance. Figure 12- 3 summarizes the common psychological and p hysiological 
reactions to alcohol.   
Alcohol has other effects on the body that are of particular concern to crewmembers. Alcohol affects the fluid in the inner 
ear that is used for orientation. This effect may contribute to spatial disorientation and airsickness. Additionally, small 
amounts of alcohol are sufficient to significantly disrupt sleep patterns, leading to mental and physical fatigue. Alcohol, 
being a sedative, deprives the body from receiving the necessary mental restorativ e sleep called rapid eye m ovement 
(REM) sleep. Failure to achieve REM sleep leads to attention problems and decreases your ability to cope with in -flight 
stresses.

Figure 12 -3 — Reactions to Alcohol  
Residual Effects  of alcohol on the crewmember depend on the amount of alcohol  ingested. The body metabolizes pure 
alcohol at a constant rate of 1  ounce in 3 hours. Therefore, if you drink a six- pack of beer (72 ounces ), six glasses of wine 
(18 ounces ) or six shots of whiskey (6 oz.), you ingest approximately 3  ounces of alcohol (0. 5 ounce of alcohol per 12 
ounces  of beer, 3 ounces  of wine , or 1 ounce  of distilled spirits). In this situation, it takes  your body at least 9 hours to 
metabolize the alcohol.  
AFMAN  11-202 Volume 3,  “Aircrew members will not fly if any alcohol is consumed within 12 hours prior to takeoff 
(or assuming aircraft  control for UAS) or if impaired by alcohol or any other intoxicating substance, to include  the effects 
or after -effects .” 
Therefore, you can calculate the amount of alcohol you drink, stop drinking twe lve hours prior to takeoff/flight planning, 
and be legal and safe, right? Unfortunately, no, it is not th at simple. Remember, AFMAN 11-202v3 states “...to include  
the effects or after -effects .” This mean s, if you are suffering a hangover, or even a headache as the result of alcohol, you 
are not legal to fly. The bigger picture, however, is not one of legality but safety. You may be legal  after 12 hours, but 
are you safe ? 
The effects of alcohol consumption can manifest themselves for longer than 12 hours afte r drinking is stopped. Some of 
these residual effects are known as a hangover and include dehydration, headache,  and nausea.  
When alcohol is consumed, it disrupts the body’s ability to regulate water and leads to dehydration. The production of 
antidiuretic  hormone (ADH) decreases, causing the body to think there is more water in the system than required. 
Therefore, water is lost through increased urination. When this excessive urination happens, water is lost from the spaces between cells (interstitial spac es) and tissues shrink, creating abnormal tension on body organs. This abnormality is 
particularly prevalent in the tissues surrounding the brain, resulting in a painful headache. Additionally, your body is hypoglycemic, hypoxic (histotoxic hypoxia), fatig ued, and telling you that you must rest and recuperate. Unfortunately, 
the only cure for a hangover is time, rest, drinking plenty of nonalcoholic fluids (preferably water), and eating a balanced 
diet. 
The best method to avoid the dilemma of suffering a ha ngover and the residual effects of alcohol is abstinence . If this 
option is unrealistic or undesirable, moderation of alcohol intake, drinking plenty of water with the alcoholic drink, and not drinking 24 hours prior to flight increases your ability to suc cessfully complete the mission.  
Hazards Associated with Tobacco Products  
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death. ”   Also states: “ Cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 
deaths per year in the United States, including more than 41 ,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure. This 
is about one in five deaths annually, or 1,300 deaths every day  (CDC, Nov 2019) . 
The primary problems of tobacco and tobacco products are the effects of nicotine and the effects of carbon monoxide.  
Crewmembers are usually exposed to nicotine through smoking, chewing, dipping,  or inhaling (snuff) tobacco products. 
If you smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products, you also expose yourself to carbon monoxide (CO) and other toxic 
by-products of the bur ning tobacco.  
Nicotine  is classified as a drug of abuse because of its addictive characteristics. Nicotine is also a highly toxic drug. For 
example, if 60 milligrams (mg) of nicotine (an amount approximately one -half the size of a match head) is ingested i t is 
sufficient to cause death in humans within minutes. The amount of nicotine contained in three average cigarettes can 
cause death if injected intravenously.  
Smoking is the primary means by which Americans expose themselves to nicotine. Nicotine is read ily absorbed in the 
lungs and reaches the brain within 8 seconds after inhalation. The acute effects of nicotine on a person, who has not developed a tolerance to the drug, includes increased blood pressure, heart rate, hand tremors, nausea, salivation, 
vomiting, cold sweat, headache, dizziness, disturbed vision and hearing, mental confusion, and marked weakness. 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 123 
Nicotine acts primarily as a CNS depressant but, if combined with caffeine, it has the opposite effect (stimulant). People 
eventually develop a to lerance to nicotine, become dependent on the drug, and do not readily show the adverse effects of 
nicotine. However, even chronic smokers experience increased blood pressure, heart rate, and hand tremors after one or two cigarettes.  
With the increased soci al stigma attached to smoking and the increased awareness of the health hazards associated with 
it, many people think that switching to “smokeless tobacco” is a favorable alternative. “Dipping” and “chewing” involves placing tobacco in the mouth, either between the cheek and gum or chewing leaf tobacco. Nicotine is not absorbed well in the mouth and if swallowed causes severe gastric upset and vomiting. Unfortunately, chewing or dipping tobacco increases the incidence of mouth, gum, tongue,  and cheek cancer s. 
When tobacco burns there are roughly 4,000 chemical compounds given off and inhaled by the smoker. Tobacco smoke can be separated into gaseous and particulate phases. The gaseous components contain CO, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide 
(HCN), volatile hydrocarb ons, and other toxic agents. The particulate components of tobacco smoke are water, nicotine, 
and numerous documented cancer causing agents. The particulate phase also contains several radioactive compounds, 
like polonium 210, contributing to the cancer ca using effects of other compounds.  
Carbon Monoxide  is one of the major by products of tobacco smoke. The danger to you from CO  is its effect on the 
oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (hypemic hypoxia). CO binds to red blood cells with roughly 200 to 250 t imes 
greater  affinity  than oxygen. According to FAA research, smoking can  raise th e body’s physiological altitude anywhere 
from 2 ,000 to 7,000 feet because of the increased amount of carbon monoxide in the blood. Your visual acuity is 
decreased because of decreased oxygen transport to the eye. There are other problems caused by a combination of the CO and other combustion by- products.  
The effects of smoking on the crewmember are decreased resistance to hypoxia because of the CO load on the red blood cells a nd the HCN inhaled. Motor skills may also be affected because of the effect of nicotine on the nervous tissues and 
peripheral blood vessels. The long- term effects of smoking include increased stress on the respiratory system due to lung 
damage, increased cardiovascular disease due to increased atherosclerosis (blocking and hardening of the arteries), 
increased threat of forming blood clots, and the danger of cancer and other long term diseases caused by tobacco smoke 
by-products.  
In summary, the use of toba cco will reduce a crewmember’s tolerance to other flight stress and can decrease performance.  
Nutrition  
In order for the human body to function, it must have fuel to burn. The fuel the human body uses is a sugar called glucose. When you eat, the glucose li berated during the digestion process enters the blood stream and is transported to the organs 
and tissues needing it, or taken to the liver where it is stored as glycogen.  
Nervous tissue (the nerves and brain) and retinal tissue (photoreceptive tissue in the back of the eye) are both dependent 
on blood sugar levels to function. When glucose levels in the blood fall below levels adequate to supply these tissues, the 
liver converts glycogen to glucose and releases it into the 
blood stream.  
Hypoglycemia 
Hypog lycemia results when the glycogen stores in the liver 
are depleted and there is not enough glucose in the blood 
stream. Hypoglycemia means “low blood sugar” and has a 
variety of causes. The most common cause is skipping meals 
or eating foods that are predo minantly simple sugars. Other 
causes of hypoglycemia are high protein/low carbohydrate 
diets and diets where a crewmember does not eat for 
extended periods of time (fasts or starvation diets).  
Short -Term Symptoms  of hypoglycemia are shakiness, 
decreased mental ability, physical weakness, irritability, fatigue,  and sleepiness. These symptoms arise within 4 to 6 
hours after your last meal. However, if you had a meal of 
complex carbohydrates, like pasta, potatoes, or whole wheat 
breads, hypoglycemia does not occur as quickly. If your last 
meal consisted of simple carbohydrates, like those found in  
Figure 12 -4 — Blood Sugar Levels  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 124 
candy and soft drinks, then hypoglycemia occurs much more quickly because of the rapid digestion and rapid metabolism 
of the simple sugars.  
Complex carbohydrates, pro teins,  and fat require more time for digestion and utilization. Their glucose is slowly released 
into the blood and stored in the liver over a period of time, avoiding erratic shifts in metabolism. Simple carbohydrates are absorbed into the blood quickly, causing the blood sugar level to rise dramatically. As the blood sugar rises, the brain 
senses there is too much glucose in the blood and signals the pancreas to release insulin into the blood stream which acts 
to remove glucose from the blood and take it to the liver. Unfortunately, if the blood sugar levels are high, insulin removes most of the sugar, leaving a blood sugar level that is lower than before the candy was eaten. Figure 12 -4 shows a 
hypothetical time line of blood sugar levels for a crewmember  flying while following a diet consisting of simple sugars. 
As clearly shown in Figure 12- 4, relying on a typical “Coke and candy” meal sets you up for hypoglycemia.  
Long -Term Symptoms  can include convulsions and fainting, usually occurring as a result of large swings in blood sugar 
levels. One of the major effects of hypoglycemia is a lapse in mental processes. When the brain cannot get the glucose it needs from the blood, it begins to slow down. For a crewmember, common symptoms are math errors, checklist errors, 
and decreased attention span which causes missed -communication errors and perception errors.  
Prevention  of Hypoglycemia is to e at regularly. When meals are missed, 
snacks of complex carbohydrates are more beneficial than candy and soft 
drinks. Figure 12 -5 lists some snacks that keep the amount of sugar in the 
blood at a constant level.  
The bottom line on nutrition and flying is to eat sensible meals containing 
complex carbohydrates low in fat, at regular intervals. If you are 
accustomed to eating three meals a day, then try not to skip a meal since 
the glycogen stores in your liver may become depleted. Avoid fad diets or high protein/low carbohydrate diets designed to build bul k. 
Furthermore, protein is an inefficient source of energy and is primarily 
used to build muscle and bone. Carbohydrates, however, are efficient 
sources of energy and are easily converted to glucose.  
Thermal Stress  
Dehydration  
Dehydration, like hypoglycemi a, is a major contributor to fatigue. There are varying degrees of dehydration, with 
different symptoms. Unfortunately, most people are constantly in a slightly dehydrated condition. When dehydration is 
combined with the flying environment, you fatigue qui ckly and are at a higher risk of experiencing decompression 
sickness, spatial disorientation, visual illusions, airsickness, and loss of situational awareness.  
A common first indication of dehydration is a sensation of thir st. At this point, your body’s wa ter content is 1 -2 percent 
low. If you are flying in a pressurized cockpit while 2 percent dehydrated, th is level of dehydration increases rapidly. In 
an aircraft, the cock pit air is frequently 5 to 10  percent relative humidity, causing water loss as you breathe. Combine 
this water loss with the diuretic effects of caffeinated drinks (coffee, colas) and you can quickly become 3 percent or more dehydrated.  
At a dehydration level of 3 percent, you may experience sleepiness, nausea, mental impairment, and ment al and physical 
fatigue. If you fly after a night of drinking alcoholic beverages, you will reach the 3 percent dehydration level more quickly than other crewmembers because of the diuretic effects of alcohol. In addition to mental impairment, dehydration 
decreases your ability to do physical work (performing an anti -G straining maneuver for example).  
The best method to prevent the problems of dehydration in the aircraft is to drink plenty of water before, during,  and after 
a flight. If water is unappealing  or unpalatable, drinks that are low in sugar, nonalcoholic, and decaffeinated can be 
substituted. Many crewmembers prefer “sports drinks” like Gatorade
®. These drinks are fine but some contain higher 
amounts of salt the body normally needs. In addition, s ome of the drinks are heavily sugared. Usually, you don’t lose 
enough salts or electrolytes during normal activity to warrant the use of these types of drinks. However, if you prefer 
sports drinks to water, then drink whatever you like best providing it is  not alcoholic, caffeinated or heavily sugared. 
Staying hydrated before, during,  and after flying has a pronounced positive effect on how well you perform flight duties.

Fatigue  
In any human- machine system, including weapons systems, the most unpredictable  component in the system is the 
human. After training and currency, the greatest contributor to tha t human variability is fatigue.  
Fatigue is defined as a state of diminished mental and physical efficiency. Unfortunately, fatigue is an insidious stressor 
because crewmembers usually become mentally fatigued before they become physically fatigued. If you self -medicate 
and fly when you are sick, suffer from a hangover, are dehydrated, hypoglycemic, or any combination of these stresses, you increase fatigue’s effect on your ability to safely accomplish the mission. Therefore, all the self -imposed stresses 
discussed previously have a direct effect on your fatigue levels.  
Types of Fatigue  
Fatigue is divided into three categories, acute fatigue, cumulative fatigue,  and chronic fatigue.  
Acute fatigue is short -term fatigue caused by the normal daily activities of the crewmember or an extended duty day or 
an “all -nighter.” It’s remedied with a good night’s sleep. Unfortunately, if you fail to remedy acute fatigue, then  you 
begin to suffer from cumulative fatigue.  
Cumulative fatigue builds up across several waking and duty periods when there is inadequate sleep or recovery between the duty periods. Recovery from cumulative fatigue cannot be accomplished in one good -quali ty, nocturnal sleep period.  
Chronic fatigue is long -term fatigue and is caused by a variety of factors. Chronic fatigue may set in after 1 to 2 weeks 
of cumulative fatigue. Other major causes of chronic fatigue in crewmembers include interrupted or poor sl eep patterns, 
circadian rhythm shifts, illness, successive long missions with minimal recuperation time, and succumbing to self -
imposed stresses. Additionally, chronic fatigue may also be due to motivational exhaustion, or chronic night work/shifts.  
Fatigu e Symptoms  
Each aircrew member must be aware of their individual symptoms of fatigue and become sensitive to signs of fatigue. A simple mistake may be due to a loss of situational awareness or sleep. But you are more susceptible to a loss of SA when 
you ar e fatigued. You have to recognize symptoms in yourself and in your crew. The main effect of fatigue is a 
progressive withdrawal of attention. When people must continue working beyond the point at which they can effectively perform their tasks they experien ce a disinclination to continue work. Eventually, withdrawal is so insidious that operators 
may be unaware of it and unable to recover. Here is a list of common symptoms of fatigue:  
Feeling of being “behind”  Micro sleep  
Poor perform ance on basic tasks  Accept lower standards  
Trouble focusing Lack of patience  
Disconnected thoughts  Increased  reaction times  
Erratic control (e.g., driving)  Decreased  motivation  
Poor conversation  Decreased attention span  
Irritable/loss of patience  Reduced situational awareness  
Fatigue is normally caused by the common day -to-day activities a crewmember performs. However, problems also arise 
when the crewmember fails to gain adequate sleep and acute fatigue evolves into chronic fatigue.  
Required Sleep Time  
According to the National Sleep Foundation, the amount of sleep needed always depends on the individual   
(Figure 12 -6). Usually, the minimum amount of sleep to maintain performance during sustained operations is 6 –8 hours 
per day. Fragmented sleep is less effe ctive than continuous sleep (e.g.,  sleep 6 –8 hours, not 3 –4 hours twice). Every hour 
less than what is needed has a negative impact on performance. An individual may not notice it on the first day, but sleep loss is cumulative. For example, if on two consecutive days an individual only gets 7 hours, 2 hours of sleep is lost that needs to be made up.  
The aver age sleep length in humans is 7– 9 hours per day. For most airmen, the normal s leep length can be reduced by 
1–2 hours for an extended period wi thout significantly affecting performance, but once the sleep restriction period ends, 
airmen have to revert to their normal sleep length. Five hours of sleep per night should be considered the absolute 
minimum for longer -term operations  (e.g., 14 days). G reater sleep restrictions result in adverse effects on behavior, 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 126 
physiology, and performance. Sudden or significant sleep deprivation should be expected to degrade menta l skills, mood, 
and motivation.  
 
Figure 12 -6 — Required Sleep Time  
Sleep Latency  
Sleep  latency is the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep. It is used to determine the amount of sleep deprivation and 
may be used to determine if an individual has a disorder. The time it takes to fall asleep is also dependent on the time of 
day. Obvious ly, when the body is at a circadian low, the body falls asl eep more easily . A normal time is 10 –15 minutes 
during the after noon low. Most Americans take 5 –10 minutes, and most Americans are sleep deprived. Any less than 5 
minutes indicates a severe sleep d eprivation or a medical disorder.  
Sleep Cycle  
Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, indicated by 
darkened bars in Figure 12 -7, and Non-REM ( NREM ) 
alternate  throughout the sleep period. Most deep sleep 
occurs in the first half of the sleep period and REM 
periods  become longer and more regular later in the sleep 
period.  Sleep periods occur in natural cycles that are 
about 90 to 100 minutes long, plus time for sleep latency 
(the time to fall asleep).  
The body continues on 90 minute cycles for the duration 
of sleep.  REM sleep is just a step away from 
wakefulness. It is where dreaming occurs. It is the mind’s way of restoring itself. You need dream sleep as much as the physical recuperation. When you remember your 
dreams, you awoke in the REM stage.  
For example, if yo u have awakened in the middle of the night, remembering your dreams, you naturally awoke from 
REM sleep. You usually feel refreshed. Then, you go back to sleep, are awakened by the alarm, you can’t remember your 
dreams, and now you feel worse than you did when you awoke a couple hours ago. This illustrates sleep inertia and 
waking up in NREM sleep.  
NREM sleep is the physical recuperation and the body stays in deep sleep longer than REM sleep to recover the body. The more sleep deprived you are, the faster y ou enter deep sleep. However, in the second half of the night, once the body 
has completed most of its physical recuperation, it does not need to enter such a deep stage and it may not need to be in 
that stage for very long. The drawback to entering deep s leep is the possible sleep inertia when you are awakened from 
it. 
Alcohol can promote relaxation and thereby help a person fall asleep, but it also produces easily disrupted, lighter sleep. 
It suppresses REM sleep in the first half of the night, leading to  REM rebound and withdrawal effects in the second half.

Circadian Rhythm 
There are normal, inherent, 
unavoidable, 24- hr rhythms in human 
cognitive and physical performance 
(Figure 12 -8). Most of these circadian 
rhythms oscillate between a high point 
late in the day to a low point in the pre -
dawn hours with a peak- to-trough 
amplitude of about 5% to 10% of their average value. Human circadian rhythms are slightly longer than one 
cycle per day but are normally slaved, 
or entrained, to exactly one cycle per 
day by external time cues (often 
referred to by the German word for time 
cues, zeitgebers ), especially the 
daylight -darkness cycle.  
Everyone has a circadian (circa = about, dian = a day) rhythm or “body clock ,” which is roughly a 23 –26 hour cycle of body fun ctions. These cyclic body functions 
include endocrine gland function (hormones, etc.), metabolic processes, and body temperatures. These functions help 
control sleep -wake cycles and directly affect your alertness and performance. This cycle is repetitive d ay in and day out 
with little change. When your circadian rhythm is disrupted, chronic fatigue can become a major factor in your 
performance. There are two basic types of circadian rhythm problems: sleep cycle disruptions  and circadian 
desynchronization due to rapid time zone changes.  
Sleep Cycle Disruptions  — Occur when you must fly during hours you would normally be sleeping. Examples are night 
or early morning (0100 hours to 0600 hours) flights. Additionally, crewmembers involved with war games or exercises (remaining on duty for extended periods of time) suffer sleep cycle disruptions. If you’re forced to wake -up early over a 
long period of time, 7 to 10 days for instance, then you lose a part of your sleep cycle that is vital to mental alertness. You can experience mental fatigue resulting in decreased at tention span, concentration, and an increase in thinking and 
perceptual errors. Additionally, you fall asleep much easier and can experience “microsleeps” in which the brain briefly 
slips into dream activity. Fortunately, microsleeps only last a few second s but are insidious and indicate that you are very 
fatigued. You can attempt to minimize or eliminate sleep cycle disruptions by adjusting the time you go to bed. This 
adjustment compensates, to a degree, for the early morning wake ups and your circadian r hythm eventually adapts to 
getting up early. Circadian rhythm desynchronization, however, is much more involved and difficult to remedy.  
Circadian Rhythm Desynchronization  — Occurs when you cross time zones (transmeridian travel). This problem is 
commonly known as “jet lag.” For the crewmember, jet lag is a serious problem that can jeopardize safety of flight. 
Physiologically, the body requires 24 hours to completely recove r from every one hour shift in time zone. To a non- flying 
officer arriving in Germany on a permanent duty assignment, this time zone shift is not a problem since they stay in one location and do not need to fly. However, it is  a problem for crewmembers lan ding in England after an 8 hour (and eight 
time zone change) flight from the U.S. They may not be able to take the required time to completely recover from the time shift, since operational demands rarely permit crewmembers 8 days off to resynchronize.  
For crewmembers that do not remain in one time zone for more than 24 hours, the problem of circadian desynchronization 
is compounded. The negative effects of circadian desynchronization, and subsequent sleep loss, on a crewmember’s 
ability to function mentall y and physically are critical. Most of the problems relate to decreased mental information 
processing abilities, decreased mental agility, impaired judgment/decision making skills, decreased communication and 
problem solving skills, and increased irritabil ity. Unfortunately, there are no set rules or procedures to follow regarding 
adaptation to changes in time zone. However, there are some techniques that you can use in an attempt to deal with time zone changes and circadian desynchronization.  
When you chan ge time zones, you basically have four options at your disposal. First, you can attempt to stay on home 
time. Second, you can slowly adapt to the new time zone naturally. Third, you can force your routine and conform to the 
local time in order to rapidly a dapt to the new time zone. Finally, you can combine aspects from the first three options. 
In any case, the decision should be based on your personal judgment but also should consider the following variables.   
Figure 12 -8 — Circadian Rhythm  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 128 
Variables Affecting Circadian Rhythm  
Direction o f Travel  — Transmeridian flight involves traveling east or west across different time zones. If you travel 
eastbound, you are essentially traveling ahead in time. For example, if you leave the west coast and fly directly to Rhein -
Main AB in Germany, you ex perience a time shift that is 10 hours ahead of your local time. If you depart the west coast 
at 0800 hours Pacific Standard Time (PST) and fly for 12 hours to Rhein- Main AB, Germany, you land at 0600 hours 
(the following day) local German time (Takeoff 08 00 + 12 hour flight + 10 hour time zone change = Land at 0600). 
Unfortunately, your body clock is set to PST. So physiologically, you are landing at 2000 hours. Your body is preparing 
for rest and sleep while the local population is just waking up. You pro bably experience one good night’s rest the evening 
you arrive because of the acute fatigue but start having sleep -cycle problems on the second day and night.  
Aircrews experiencing an eastbound circadian shift experience trouble falling asleep at local times, trouble rising at 
normal local times, and lose mentally restorative sleep. These problems are similar to those associated with westbound 
travel with one major problem added. Because their body clock is slow to respond naturally to the new time zone (24 
hours to adapt to a one hour change in time), they do not obtain the sleep necessary to correct for fatigue.  
The body has an easier time adjusting to westbound travel. Circadian desynchronization is still evident but the 
physiological signs are not as seve re as eastbound travel. The primary reason westbound travel is easier on the crew is 
that the crew is traveling backward in time. A crew taking off from San Antonio, Texas and flying to Hickam AFB, 
Hawaii (an 8 hour flight) experiences a 7 hour time shift.  If the crew takes off at 0800 Central Standard Time (CST), they 
land at 0900 hours Hawaiian time (Hawaii’s local time is 7 hours behind CST.) The effect on the crew is that they become 
tired and sleepy earlier in the day and wake up earlier in the morning . The result is the crew is mentally efficient in the 
mornings but their capabilities decrease more rapidly towards the afternoon. It still takes the crewmember 7 days to naturally adapt to their new time zone but they can tolerate the physiological change s better than eastbound travelers.  
Magnitude of Time Zone Change  — You need to consider how many time zone changes you are experiencing. The 
number of changes gives you an idea of the degree of jet lag you are going to encounter and helps you decide how to  deal 
with its effects. If a crew flies eastward and only crosses three time zones, they may not experience serious circadian desynchronization. However, if they are flying to Saudi Arabia (11 hours ahead of a west coast base) they may experience 
serious p erformance decrements within a day or two of their arrival.  
Interval Between Arrival and Departure of Next Flight  — This variable requires consideration to estimate the 
possible negative effects circadian desynchronization has on follow -on flight activity. How long you stay in one time 
zone impacts the methods you use to cope with circadian rhythm disruption. If the time between landing and your next 
flight is short (13 -24 hours), you need to plan your rest periods differently than if you have a longer time between flights.  
The shorter the time interval between landing and the next flight, the more you need to maintai n your home -time rest and 
sleep habits. If the duration between landing and flight is long, then you should adjust your rest and sleep cycles in an 
attempt to adjust your circadian rhythms to local time and gain the rest needed before flight.  
Relative Diff iculty of Next Flight  — A major consideration. Many times a crew experiences new flying environments 
that have different local procedures than their home base. If they fly in a foreign country, the terminology used by 
controllers could be different and cau se confusion in the cockpit. If the crew is fatigued, their ability to adapt to new 
flying environments and demands is decreased.  
Additionally, aspects of the flight itself need to be considered. Are there portions of the flight requiring above average alertness on the part of the crew? For instance, is low -level flight, aerial refueling, ord nance delivery, or other high 
attention related tasks required? Is weather likely to be a factor? For example, is there icing, thunderstorms, visibility restrictions ca used by rain, snow, or fog? Is the mission scheduled as a day or night sortie? How are the crew’s circadian 
desynchronization and the timing of the flight likely to affect their performance? Finally, what is the experience level of 
the crew for the type of  mission scheduled? Experience not only includes the crew’s overall flying experience but their 
recency of experience (when was the last time they flew a mission of this sort?) and specificity of experience (have they 
flown this type of mission before?). C onsideration of this particular variable guides the crew in forming a plan to cope 
with fatigue. Additionally, it increases their awareness of the fatigue factor during the later stages of the flight.  
Availability of Dining Facilities  — In addition to rest, the body needs nourishment to provide energy. One of the ways 
to help adapt to a new time zone is a good diet. However, if the local dining facilities are closed when you land, then you 
need to consider adjusting your schedule prior  to their next scheduled duty period to include time for eating a good meal. 
If dining facilities are unavailable, you should make plans to take “combat snacks” (nonperishables consisting of complex 
carbohydrates). Also, starting a weight loss diet on the road is not wise. Most common weight loss diets (low calorie intake) are an added stressor the body must cope with in addition to circadian desynchronization.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 129 
Direction of Next Destination  — If you are not going to stay in one location for an appreciable length of time, but are 
going to travel on, you need to consider the direction (east or west) of your next destination and the effect it has on your 
circadian rhythm. If the direction of tr avel is north or south, the time zone does not change and there isn’t any effect  on 
circadian rhythm. If you travel east or west, circadian disruption can worsen or improve depending on the direction of 
travel in relation to your home base.  
Adapting to a N ew Time Zone — There are no hard and fast rules or effective procedures on how to adapt to a new 
time zone. Regardless of whether or not you decide to adapt to the new time zones, there are techniques that can guide you on dealing with circadian desynchronization.  
If you decide to rapidly adapt to the new time zone, you should force yourself into the local routine. Use your willpower 
and alarm clock to force yourself to wake up at normal local times in the morning. To help go to sleep at night, try mild to moderate exercise and a relaxing shower or bath (if available). Above all, moderation or elimination of alcohol and 
caffeine helps.  
As one can see, the problem of circadian rhythm desynchronization is complex and has many variables to take into 
account during mission planning. Between sorties, ensure you and your crew are able to get adequate crew rest along 
with nutrition. Allow either the aircraft commander or your supervisor to know when you feel you are too fatigued to fly. Remember, as long as you are aware of yo ur options, including Air Force and major command (MAJCOM) policy, you 
should be able to form a plan to reduce the effect circadian rhythm shifts have on your performance.  
Other Factors Affecting Sleepiness  
Physical or physiological fatigue can be described as the temporary loss of the ability to respond due to repeated or continuous stimulation of the muscles (e.g., during strenuous exercise). Thus, aircrews can suffer from physiological fatigue as a result of engaging in intense physical work.  
Mental fati gue or boredom is the feeling of weariness that results from repetitive performance of nonphysical tasks. 
Aircrews can be affected after only a few minutes of performing monotonous work. Repetitive performance of even fairly complex tasks can result in men tal fatigue. Mental fatigue can also be caused or made worse by anxiety, apprehension, 
frustration, and stress.  
A sense of fatigue is the first indicator that people are getting tired, but generally is not recognized in our motivated flyin g 
population. In a normally close- knit squadron interpersonal dynamics, everyone’s sense of humor may be the first thing 
to change. As a management tool this can be a useful clue for aircraft commanders.  
Fatigue and Alcohol Effects Similarities  
Both alcohol intoxicatio n (Brust, 2004) and fatigue arising from sustai ned wakefulness (Broadbent, 2013 ) have long been 
known to have detrimental effects on cognitive function. Howeve r, studies directly compared the effects of fatigue and 
alcohol intoxication on performance in the sa me cognitive tests (Dawson and Reid, 1997; Lamond and Dawson, 1999; 
Williamson and Feyer, 2000). The findings from all three studi es agree that as little as 18 –24 hours of sustained 
wakefulness could induce impairments in the speed and accuracy of cognitiv e performance that were equal to or greater 
than the severity of impairment seen in individuals with blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 0.1%. While there were 
differences in the extent to which the high levels of alcohol and fatigue affected different cognitive functions, measures 
of performance speed were always impaired by both conditions.

Figure 12 -9 — Fatigue and Alcohol Effects Similarities  
Cognitive performance is impaired by fatigue arising from sustained wakef ulness and alcohol. These  papers (D awson 
and Reid, 1997; Lamond and Dawson, 1999; Williamson and Feyer, 2000) directly compared the effects of increasing 
fatigue and blood alcohol concentration (%BAC) to provide a  framework for understanding fatigue -related cognitive 
impairment. While the e xpression of fatigue -related cognitive impairments in terms of %BAC equivalents is sound, the 
methodology in each study was flawed in that the statistics used to compare the effects of %BAC and fatigue on cognition did not account for variation between or within each condition. The point estimates of the difference between a baseline 
and any level of fatigue or %BAC provided no indication of the size of difference that could reasonably be expected by 
chance. Importantly, all studies showed that variation in creased as cognitive performance declined because of both 
increasing fatigue and %BAC.  
The graph above is ext racted from a current study (Falleti et al., 2003 ) which compared the effect of increasing levels of 
%BAC and fatigue on the simple reaction task f rom the ir CogState ® test battery on 40 healthy adults using statistical 
methods that account for intra- individual and within -group variability in performance. After 24  hours of sustained 
wakefulness and with 0.08%BAC, individuals showed maximal cognitive i mpairment; however, the magnitude of 
impairment found for fatigue was equivalent only to that obser ved for 0.05%BAC. Despite Falleti ’s study (2003 ) 
detecting smaller impairments in fatigue -related cognitive impairment than has been reported previously, the “magnitude 
of impairment we did observe is still serious.” Even accounting for intra - and inter -subject variability, the cog nitive 
impairment found at 24– 26 hours of sustained wakefulness was greater than that associated with %BAC levels at which 
many jur isdictions consider the operation of a motor vehicle to be unsafe and therefore illegal.  
Individual Factors Cause Fatigue to Affect Individuals Differently  
Each person treats their crew rest differently. Who actually got sleep? How long have you been awake? Those are 
questions that you may have to answer. Older individuals do not sleep as long, but the quality of sleep is not as great. The more physically fit you are, the less susceptible you are to fatigue. Is the day hot? Is a person suffering from a 
hangover? Dehydration increases fatigue. Drink plenty of water before and during the sortie to combat against it.  
How is the sortie itself? How long is it? Is it a CT ride? What are the deviations to the norm? Just like a Risk Management 
checklist for the miss ion, you must do an ORM checklist for yourself.  
Decreasing the Effects of Fatigue 
Prior to Flight  — There are many ways crewmembers can try to compensate for the effects of fatigue. First, always start 
your scheduled flights well rested, especially when scheduled for extended missions or transcontinental travel. This 
proper rest often requires cooperation from family members. Good sleep hygiene involves proactive sleep scheduling 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 131 
and quantity, good sleep habits, and a good sleep environment. The following a re considered good sleep habits that will 
generally lead to better sleep quality:  
Stick to a consistent wake -up time and bedtime every day of the week  
Use the bedroom only for sleep and sex.  
Resolve daily dilemmas outside of the bedroom.  
Establish a bedtim e routine.  
Establish an aerobic exercise routine and stick to it.  
Create a quiet and comfortable sleep environment.  
Don’t be a clock watcher.  
Don’t consume caffeine within 4 hours of bedtime.  
Don’t use alcohol as a sleep aid.  
Don’t take naps during the day (if you have trouble sleeping at night.)  
Don’t smoke cigarettes immediately before bedtime.  
Get out of bed and go to another room if sleep doesn’t come in 30 minutes.  
Naps  (not longer than two hours) are strongly recommended prior to night flights or cont inuing an extended trip. You 
should also minimize the use of tobacco and alcohol , and ensure you are well hydrated.  
You can also use diet  to reduce the effects of fatigue. Avoid high fat, high carbohydrate meals to reduce drowsiness. 
Instead, emphasize a m eal moderately high in protein with moderate carbohydrates. Additionally, avoid eating large, 
filling meals prior to flight to reduce the chance of drowsiness. It’s more beneficial, in this instance, to eat several smaller 
meals (snacks) rather than a full  meal at a single seating.  
To help maintain an adequate diet, you can carry “emergency rations” or “combat snacks.” This option is invaluable if 
you are not fond of box lunches. You can take a supply of canned fruit, canned meat (tuna, ham, chicken), beef jerky, 
trail mix or other complex carbohydrate and protein rich foods with you. This food is also a benefit should you sleep 
through the dining facility hours.  
During the Flight  — You can reduce the effects of fatigue by staying active. It is also importan t to identify potential 
problem or lull areas of the sortie. If at night, dusk, or dawn, the cockpit lights can be turned up in- flight and turned down 
again 30 minutes prior to landing to restore night vision. Also, snacking and chewing also helps with in -flight alertness.  
When fatigued, it is important to increase your awareness of coordinated critical flight functions, such as approach, landing or low -level operations. Be aware of the potential for increased errors due to fatigue and cross -check fellow 
crewmember activities. This is especially critical during flights over the pond and/or cross -country flights with extended 
loiter times.  
Caffeine  Use 
Caffeine is a tasteless substance occurring naturally in plants and found in a variety of beverages, medicin es, and foods. 
Coffee is the most popular source of caffeine in the American diet. Crewmembers can also receive significant amounts of caffeine from carbonated beverages, tea, OTC drugs,  and chocolate.  
Caffeine acts as a powerful CNS stimulant. Caffeine’s popularity is due to its ability to elevate mood, mask feelings of 
fatigue,  and increase the capacity for work. In low doses, caffeine may not be harmful. However, ingestion of high levels 
of caffeine may be related to a variety of acute and chronic ailmen ts. Most people regard caffeine as a safe stimulant and 
do not actively monitor their intake. As they consume caffeine -loaded products, they remain unaware of the potential 
negative side effects of caffeine. Figure 12 -10 illustrates the effects of too much  caffeine and associated withdrawal 
symptoms.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 132 
Addiction — Caffeine is addicting. A person requiring 400 mg of caffeine 
in a 24 hour period to function is considered a ddicted to caffeine. Figure 12 -
11 shows the amount of caffeine present in common food/beverages and 
OTC drugs. If you ingest too much caffeine, y ou can experience the effects 
depicted in Figure 12 -10. However, you can also develop sensitivity to the 
drug. If a person is addicted to caffeine, they can experience some 
withdrawal symptoms when, and if, they decide to quit. The withdrawal symptoms comm only include headaches but can be as severe as muscle 
cramps, nausea, aches in joints and muscles, and psychological feelings of 
anxiety, dread, and irritation. If you are addicted to caffeine, it is advisable to reduce intake gradually instead of quittin g altogether.  
Caffeine has synergistic effects when used in combination with other drugs. Its stimulant effect on the body is significantly increased when used in combination with decongestants or nicotine. An example of the deliberate 
use of caffeine as a synergistic drug is its use in OTC diet pills. Until recently, 
diet pill manufacturers combined caffeine with decongestants in order to 
increase the body’s metabolic rate. Unfortunately, the negative side effects 
of this combination, sweating, increased b lood pressure and heart rate, sleep 
disturbances, and shakiness or tremor, are not desirable in crewmembers. Dehydration is another, more common, 
synergistic effect of caffeine.  
 
Figure 12 -11 — Caffeine Amounts  
Dehydration  — If you drink caffeinated bever ages during flight, ensure you also drink water. The combination of a 
pressurized cabin (humidity below 9 to 11 percent increases water lost during respiration) and the diuretic (makes one urinate more often) effect of caffeine causes an increased dehydrat ion rate. The result is increased mental and physical 
fatigue and decreased performance. Drinking water, or other non -caffeinated beverages, during flight helps offset the 
negative effects of caffeine.  
Go/No -Go Pill Program  
Flight Medicine establishes a pr ogram to ground test, dispense, and control pharmacological agents for fatigue 
manage ment IAW AFI 48 -123, AFMAN  11-202v 3, and current AF policy. The SGP counsels, with the Go Pill approval 
authority (wing or deployed commander), the medical utility of usin g Go Pills for a particular mission or mission set. 
The SGP will ensure appropriate non -pharmacological fatigue prevention strategies and operational countermeasures are 
utilized prior to concurring with operational Go  Pill use.  
Go/No -Go pill ground testing  and operational use is voluntary. The flight surgeon ( FS) offers ground testing for Go/No-
Go pills to select eligible aircrew prior to use in an operational setting. Documentation of successful ground testing or 
deferral is entered in the medical record of eligible aircrew. All aircrew are “ duties not involving flying ” (DNIF) while 
ground testing both Go and No- Go Pills. 
Eligibility for the operational use of pharmacologic sedatives (No -Go) requires appropriate ground testing and approval 
of the local FS.  Aircrew will declare themselves DNIF after use of sedative for the specified time as annotated in the 
Official AF Aerospace Medicine Approved Medications list and as instructed by the FS.

Thermal Stress  
With exposure to thermal stressors  (i.e., heat, cold ), the body must maintai n the core temperature through the balance of 
heat gain and heat loss. If the rate of heat production (i.e., environmental, metabolic, hormonal, or food thermogenesis) 
is greater than the rate of heat loss , then the net is a heat ga in and the positive heat storage results in hyperthermia. 
Conversely, if heat  loss (i.e., through conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation) is greater than heat  gain, then 
the net is heat debt  and the negative heat storage results in hypothermia.  Three stages of heat stress:  
Heat exhaustion (99.5 – 101 °F)  
Performance decrements occur  
Process starts with only a 1 -degree increase in body temperature 
Poor correlation between early stage of declining performance and appearance of any physical symptom s 
May be an initial increased feeling of confidence  
Any symptoms are important  
Minor discomforts, confusion, disorientation, memory loss etc., cannot be taken for granted or accepted as inevitable  
Regular self -evaluations of performance and how you are feeling should be SOP  
Heat cramps (101 –  105 °F)  
Normally caused by severe physical work (individually relative) in the heat  
Highly dependent on individual work capacity and level of acclimatization  
If symptoms are not ignored, they can act as a fail -safe to avoid heatstroke (stop work before heat stroke temperature 
is achieved).  
However, it’s possible to push yourself into a heatstroke.  
A red face and hot skin are common signs of emerging heat illness.  
Fatigue  
Nausea/vomiting  
Giddiness  
Cramps  
Rapid breathing 
Fainting  
Heat stroke ( >105 °F)  
This is a medical emergency, immediate cooling is necessary  
Rarely encountered in operational environment (chemical defense gear would increase susceptibility)  
More likely to be encountered in highly aerobically conditioned i ndividuals as they are used to working with high 
body temperature (101 –  103 °F)  
Body’s heat control mechanism stops working — sweating may or may not be present  
Mental confusion  
Disorientation

Figure 12 -12 — Risk Factors  
Symptoms  
Dry mouth  
Headache 
Dark  yellow urine  
Dry lips  
General fatigue  
Dizziness  
Individuals should not wait for any of these symptoms to occur, they should drink throughout the day.  
The best way to know if you are dehydrated is look at the color of your urine. It should be clear to near  clear and you 
should be going to the restroom a bout every 2 –3 hours. Your body can only absorb ½ liter of water per hour so if you are 
going to the bathroom more than every 2 hours, you are drinking too much fluid. If you are waiting longer than 3 hours 
to go to the bathroom, you are not drinking enough fluid.  
Heat Stress Countermeasures  
Working in hot environments ma y result in the production of 6 –8 liters of sweat during the work day. The normal thirst 
mechanism is not sensitive enough to keep up with this fluid loss rate.  
Acclimatization refers to the physiologic adaptation which occurs over a succession of days in individuals exposed to environmental heat stress which results in reducing the strain caused by the heat stress. For example, acclimatization  
results in increased and more efficient sweating. That is, the sweat rate increases while the amount of sodium lost per 
unit of sweat decreases. Sweating also begins at a lower core body temperature after acclimatization. Acclimatization 
also results in l owered cardiovascular strain manifested primarily by a lower heart rate.  
Do not skip meals. Food replaces the minerals lost in sweat as well as provide the needed calories. Salt food to taste, and 
do not take salt tablets.  
Inadequate rest can nullify the effects of heat acclimatization. Several medical and physiological conditions can make 
adjustment to hot environments more difficult. Sustained activity in hot environments assume work clothing is permeable 
and consists of not more than the customary long -sleeved work shirt and trousers (or equivalent). Clothing, which lowers 
air and vapor permeability, interferes with body cooling, decreasing heat tolerance.  
Cold Stress Management  
The physiological response to cold stress exposure is not the only variable m ilitary personnel need to be concerned about 
when performing operational duties; the psychological aspect of human performance is affected as well. Mission -critical 
duties might fail to be completed due to the decrease in morale and/or cognitive performance.  
Prevention  
Cold injuries are avoidable by proper use of preventive measures. Cold -weather clothing systems are designed to 
accommodate a variety of weather conditions and activity levels. Cold -weather clothing protection is based on the 
principles of insulation, layering, and ventilation. Proper clothing is made of material that water vapor can pass through 
and allows the wearer to unzip and open the clothing periodically to increase ventilation. Sweat evaporation is compromised when clothing is dirty.

UNCLASSIFIED 135 
Combatting Stress  
Stress is the normal reaction to any demand placed on you, either physically or mentally. You need stress because it 
serves as a motivator and an indicator (increased heart rate, respiration, perspiration, etc.) which helps prepare you to  
respond. If there is too little stress, you are under -aroused and inattentive. On the other hand, if there is too much stress 
you are limited in your ability to perform.  
Inherent in man is a biological response to a crisis situation. For example, when sud denly confronted by a crisis situation, 
an involuntary physiological process begins. Adrenaline is produced, causing the eyes to dilate, increasing heart rate, 
stopping digestion, directing blood to the large muscle groups, and increasing perspiration. The se responses prepare you 
to confront the crisis or run away from it (a response known as “fight or flight”).  
Financial, family, professional,  and social responsibilities are a few of the stresses which may confront you. Many of 
these are self -imposed. Even  if these stresses are not self -imposed (stresses you are personally responsible for), they may 
lead to negative behavior associated with self -imposed stress.  
Aviators live in a success oriented and competitive society and are often placed in stressful env ironments. For example, 
it’s obvious that an in -flight emergency evokes stress, but a checkride is also a form of stress. Both elicit the same 
physiological response of fight or flight. Stress is useful if you control it. If you don’t control it, it will c ontrol you. 
Therefore, effective methods for controlling or relieving stress are necessary.  
Psychological Stress  
The chart is the Yerkes -Dodson Law (1908), and illustrates the link between the physiological condition and 
performance (Figure 12 -13). For ins tance, it is believed that if a crewmember is fatigued and experiencing low blood 
sugar, the effect of stress on performance will be greater than in a fit, rested person. The nature of our human condition 
is to cope or adapt to the environment; autonomic a djustments allow for adjustments to physical stress, but adaptation 
to psychological stress is much less pronounced and harder to measure. Despite the reasonable ease of measuring heart 
rate in flight and the natural correlation between heart rate and situ ational arousal, it is important to consider 
concomitant factors such as workload (physical and mental) as well as responsibility on the flight deck when assessing 
the overall effects of stress on performance. Considering the “whole person” of a flyer, one  must also be aware of any 
acute or chronic life- situational stressors outside the aviation arena: those of family, career, health, finances, or legal 
problems, for instance. (HAOP, 2016, p. 4- 3) 
 
Figure 12 -13 — Stress Chart  
Overload  has deservedly receiv ed much attention as an important stressor. In overload the demands are such as to exceed 
the individual’s ability to meet them.  
An example of overload is role conflict. This can be viewed as a situation in which a person finds, in essence, opposed 
demand being made on him. A person may often be asked to work on one assignment when he/she already has some 
other assignment. That person may have to stop what he/she is doing at that time. When the issue concerns merely the sum total of work that must be done i rrespective of its difficulty, we talk about quantitative overload. The person has 
more work than can be done in a given period of time. That person may be fully competent in the work but time 
restrictions are what elicit the stress reaction. Quantitative overload could involve working for long hours without 
appropriate rest periods.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 136 
When the work is overloading because it requires skills, abilities and knowledge beyond what the person has, then we 
talk about qualitative overload. The work may demand contin uous concentration, innovation,  and meaningful decision. 
An important factor contributing to qualitative overload is job complexity. The higher the inherent difficulty of the work, the more stressful the job.  
In some job situations there is a combination o f both quantitative and qualitative overload; this is frequently encountered 
in aviators, particularly student aviators.  
Underload may also create stress. A job may fail to provide meaningful stimulation or adequate reinforcement. Thus, 
jobs which involve dehumanizing monotony, no opportunity to use acquired skills and expertise, an absence of any 
intellectual involvement and repetitive performance provide instances of underload. Boredom can result from too high a degree of specialization. This is a rare occurrence in student aviators.  
Stress Management  
Each crewmember is a successful competitor or would never have been selected for a military flight program. Competition is usually a healthy environment in which to function but can also be a source of stress . Constantly trying 
to succeed in a pressure environment, impressing your instructor, and outperforming your peers provide a continual 
source of stress.  
Stress can be both positive and negative. How you manage it is important to you in both your personal a nd professional 
life. To be an effective crewmember, you must learn to manage the stresses that are part of your everyday life. To begin 
managing stress, you have to first understand what it is and what it does  — how it affects you physically and mentally.  
Place Demands into Perspective — Doing well in flying training, living comfortably, and being a good parent are all 
worthwhile aspirations, but they are not life threatening situations. You can’t control the reflexive physiological process 
that activates in a crisis situation, but you can control what you perceive as a crisis situation  — so don’t over react. Keep 
your supervisor or flight commander informed. They may be able to help you deal with some of these stresses.  
Maintain a Healthy Diversity in Your Life  — Entertainment and hobbies provide a healthy balance to life. You need 
to save some of your energy for yourself. A healthy balance will make the energy you expend on your job and your 
family more effective or meaningful. The flying environment, parti cularly flying training, is a demanding one, constantly 
changing and requiring a total mental and physical commitment from you, the crewmember. Any factor or condition that bothers you  — distracting you from your work  — is important and must be given adequ ate attention.  
Eliminate Self -Imposed Stress  — Smoking, excessive drinking of alcohol, self -medicating, poor nutrition,  and lack of 
exercise are stressful in themselves, and make it more difficult to deal with other stresses. Avoiding these behaviors elimi nates their effect on the crewmember, minimizing self -imposed stress.  
Have Good Self -Assessment Habits  
One technique of self -evaluation is to think about a mishap write -up in your head.  If your 72 -hr history has significant 
stressors and “red flags” that c ould contribute to a bad situation or a mishap.  Try to keep the Positive outweighing the 
Negative, and don’t forget the I’MSAFE Checklist!  
Summary  
Roughly 85 percent of military aircraft mishaps are caused by aircrew error. Some of the major contributors t o aircrew 
error are self -imposed stresses that decrease the crew’s capacity to cope with unforeseen environmental or aircraft 
stresses.  
The major self -imposed stresses are self -medication with OTC drugs, alcohol and tobacco use, hypoglycemia and 
dehydration. Each of these contributes to fatigue, which is the crucible from which increased susceptibility to stresses 
such as spatial disorientation, visual illusions, and G -induced loss of consciousness arise. Fatigue is also a result of sleep 
cycle disruption a nd circadian rhythm shifts caused by transmeridian travel.  
Overall, you can ensure your flights are safe and productive by eliminating or minimizing self -imposed stresses. Flying 
sick, with a hangover, dehydrated, or on OTC drugs are invitations to a miser able flight at the least and the loss of life at 
the worst.  
Unnecessary stress can be controlled or avoided with observance of crew duty day, rest regulations, adequate recreation, good living quarters, and attention to morale factors. The demands of flyin g are in no way compatible with emotional 
stresses. Recognition, treatment, or better yet, avoidance of emotional stress is essential for maintaining situational 
awareness and ultimately safety. Resolution of the problems prior to flight is the only way to  prevent them from adversely

affecting you and your mission. If individual efforts to resolve these stresses are unsuccessful, seeking professional help 
is essential.  
You can increase your capacity to cope by eliminating or minimizing exposure to self -impo sed stresses. However, 
stresses such as fatigue are not always controllable. Therefore, your awareness of the causes and effects of fatigue is key to decreasing the negative manifestations. Develop plans to cope with situations where fatigue, like circadian rhythm 
desynchronization, is a threat. The best way to cope with fatigue is to minimize or eliminate self -imposed stresses and 
ensure you are in good physical shape. Exercise is one of the best methods to increase your tolerance to not only fatigue, 
but also spatial disorientation, positive Gs, and visual illusions. You must be both aerobically and anaerobically fit.  
Aerobic exercises are those causing the muscles to use oxygen to produce energy. They are activities such as running, bicycling, walking, and swimming. Activities causing an increase in respiration, heart rate, and sweating are also aerobic. Stay in your aerobic training zone by monitoring your heart rate.  
Anaerobic training isolates muscle groups and forces them to produce energy without immediately relying on oxygen. Weightlifting, sprinting, sit -ups, pull -ups, and push- ups are examples of anaerobic exercises. If you are just starting a 
weightlifting program, you should start gradually and build up to reduce the chance of injury.

Introduction 
Assisted breathing is required for high- altitude flight. Supplemental oxygen provides protection from the effects of 
reduced barometric pressure at high altitude. These systems include vari ous types of oxygen equipment. Air Force 
Manual  11-202, Vol. 3, Flight Operations , states that normally, aircrew will use supplemental oxygen anytime the cabin 
altitude exceeds 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). When mission ess ential, aircrews trained IAW AFMAN  11-403, 
Aerospace Physiological Training Program , may operate aircraft unpressurized above 10,000 feet MSL without 
supplemental oxygen IAW MAJCOM guidance and some restrictions. Supplemental oxygen is either a mixture of oxygen 

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 142 
and ambient air or 100% oxygen. Supplemental oxygen may be stored as a gas, liquid or solid. It must be free from 
contaminants.  
An aircraft oxygen system consists of the storage container  or concentrator , delivery system to regulate mixture and 
pressure, and the oxygen mask. The final and most critical component of this system is you, the knowledgeable user.  
Before we discuss the individual components of oxygen systems, we need to identify a few precautions to ensure the 
integrity of the mask and helmet.  
Facial medications and m ake-up (cosmetics) should not be used with supplemental oxygen and oxygen equipment. These 
materials include lipstick, face creams and powders, eye make- up, and false eyelashes. Residue buildup clogs valves and 
restricts oxygen flow.  
Information  
Oxygen Storage Systems  
Oxygen can be carried in cylinders or containers mounted in the aircraft. The location depends on the aircraft, but 
normally they can be found in the under -deck area near the cockpit. Military oxygen systems are classified by the storage 
state (e.g., gas or liquid) and the pressure (e.g., high or low).  
Low Pressure Gas  
Low pressure oxygen is stored in yellow cylinders. The system is considered full at 425 pounds per square inch ( psi) ± 
25 psi (400-450 psi). A low- pressure system reduces the pos sibility of explosion, requires little maintenance, but limits 
the volume of oxygen compared to high pressure and liquid systems. This limited volume requires immediate descent 
below 10,000' MSL anytime pressure drops below 100 psi. Low pressure systems wi ll not be used for flight if the 
indicated pressure is below 100 psi  (operationally empty).  
High Pressure Gas  
High pressure systems are color coded green. The system is considered full when the pressure is 1,800 psi to 2,000 psi  
and operationally empty at 200 psi. The cylinders must be heavily constructed to  contain the high pressure. Rei nforced 
cylinders reduce the danger of explosion, but increase weight. The emergency oxygen incorporated in the egress system is a high pressure system.  
Liquid Oxygen (LOX)  
The LOX system is one of the more advanced oxygen systems. Oxygen is stored in a liquid state and converted to gas by a converter. Since one unit of liquid oxygen yields about 860 units of gaseous oxygen, storing the oxygen in liquid form 
saves storage sp ace and weight. Because of the extremely low temperature of LOX (a boiling point of - 182.8°C), 
handling, and servicing the system are its only disadvantages. Low pressure LOX systems are normally found in 
single/dual seat aircraft and maintain a line press ure of approximately 70- 90 psi. High -pressure LOX systems, found on 
multi -place aircraft, and normally maintain a line pressure of 300 psi . More importantly, the oxygen is measured in liters 
by a quantity gau ge and is considered full at 95%; empty at 10%.  
Solid State  
New processes can produce oxygen from a solid state. The sodium chlorate candle is such a system. It provides emergency 
oxygen to passengers in the C -5B Galaxy via a chemical reaction. The system is contained in a canister and is activated 
by removing a continuous flow mask from the canister. The user may detect a harmless amount of chlorine for about the 
first 12 seconds. The amount of oxygen supplied depends on the size and reaction rate of the candle. The Emergency 
Escape Breathing Device (EE BD) provided in the T -1A is another example of a portable solid state oxygen storage 
system.  
On Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS)  
The OBOGS, utilized by the T -6, provides each pilot with an unlimited supply of regulated oxygen as long as the engine 
is operating normally. Oxygen is extracted from engine bleed air through a molecular sieve. The OBOGS distribution 
network also includes a plenum that provides a limited supply of oxygen in case of OBOGS failure. Duration of the plenum supply is based upon c ockpit pressure altitude, aircraft altitude, oxygen regulator setting, and pilot demand.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 143 
Oxygen Delivery Systems  
Regardless of the basic configuration, all oxygen delivery systems serve the same purpose. Oxygen flows from containers 
or an oxygen generating system through distribution lines, regulated at a suitable flow rate or pressure, and delivered to 
the mask. Two basic oxygen delivery systems used in today’s aircraft are continuous flow and pressure demand. With the exception of the oxygen generating system, which must be aircraft mounted, each type can be provided in a fixed system (aircraft mounted) or a portable system (walk -around bottle).  
Note  — Any discussion of supplemental breathing systems requires an understanding of altitude designation. The 
transition level is the altitude where the crewmember selects an altimeter setting of 29.92 during climb out and returns 
the altimeter to the local setting on descent. In the United States the transition level is 18,000' MSL (transition levels ma y 
vary betw een countries). Above the transition level, altitude is described in flight levels. For instance, an aircraft at 25,000 
is typically described as flying at FL250, which provides a convenient shorthand during radio transmissions.  
Continuous Flow  
The continuous flow delivery method is just as the name implies  — the regulator delivers continuously regardless of 
demand. To get oxygen, the aircrew opens a supply valve on the regulator. The more the valve is opened, the greater the flow of oxygen. A gauge on the regulator can be referenced so the oxygen flow can be adjusted with varying cabin 
pressure altitudes . In emergency situations, some systems contain a face piece and reservoir bag to direct the flow of 
oxygen to the nose and mouth. The operational ceiling f or this sys tem is FL250 and in an emergency, can be used to 
FL300. Some continuous flow systems are modified for use at higher altitudes and are normally installed in transport, 
medical evacuation, and commercial aircraft. The emergency oxygen cylinder in the ejection seat is a continuous flow 
system for emergency use up to FL500.  
Pressure Demand  
High -performance aircraft routinely fly above FL400 , which means their cabin altitude will be above FL280 . At these 
altitudes, 100% oxygen is insufficient to maintain normal levels of blood oxygen saturation , the regulator will then supply 
safety pressure and positive pressure breathing will become necessary . Positive pressure breathing is necessary to increase 
the lung pressure above the atmospheric pressure. This increase is n ecessary to survive at altitudes above FL280 . Narrow 
panel regulators are the most widel y used safety pressure  regulators in modern aircraft. The term narrow panel regulator 
refers to a series of regulators that are essentially the same in app earance and operation. As a result of the automatic 
features of these regulators, you are not distracted from flight duties to make the manual adjustments that were necessary with earlier models. Regulators include types CRU -68/A, CRU -69/A and CRU -73/A. Th e pressure demand system has 
an operational ceiling of FL430 and an emergency ceiling of FL500 for very short durations
. 
OBOGS Panel Regulator  
 
Figure 1 3-1 — T-6 Oxygen Regulator  
An oxygen regulator (Figure 1 3-1) is installed on t he right side console in the T -6 cockpit. Each regulator has a supply 
lever, a concentration lever, a pressure lever, a built in test (BIT) button, a flow indicator (blinker), and a maximum 
concentration flow light. Each regulator panel controls OBOGS electrical power and oxygen flow for the respective 
cockpit.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 144 
Regulator Function  
Advances in aircraft design and performance demanded improvements in early regulators. An aneroid assembly was 
incorporated to react to cabin  pressure changes and deliver oxygen under positive pressure , as it alw ays is trying to 
provide approximately  1 in Wg (inch of water gauge) safety pressure. Oxygen concentration with the lever in NORMAL 
position will range from 25% to 70% for altitudes from sea level to 15,000 feet MSL, and from 45% to 95% for altitudes 
from 15,000 feet MSL to 31,000 feet MSL. When the concentration lever for either regulator is set to MAX, the OBOGS concentration supplies the highest possible oxygen concentration (95% oxygen, 5% inert gas) to both regulators. T he 
maximum concentration light illuminates any time either concentration lever is in the MAX position. The OBOGS 
regulator provides slight positive pressure continuously while the supply lever is in the ON position. A detailed 
knowledge of the components a nd operation of the regulator is very important. The following section provides facts to 
properly operate the regulator. Reference Figure 1 3-1 as you study these components.  
Regulator Components  
Oxygen Supply Lever  — The supply lever has two positions, pla carded “ON” and “OFF.” When set to “OFF”, OBOGS 
electrical power and oxygen flow are cut off to the respective regulator. However, if the supply lever for either regulator 
(front or back seat) is “ON”, the OBOGS system is operative and if left in this position long enough, the aircraft battery 
will be run down  if the engine is not running. Both supply levers must be “OFF” to disable the OBOGS system.  
Oxygen Concentration Lever — The concentration lever has two positions, placarded “NORMAL” and “MAX.” When 
the lever is set to the “NORMAL” position, the regulator directs the OBOGS concentrator to provide the proper oxygen 
mix for the cockpit pressure altitude. When the lever is set to “MAX”, the regulator directs the OBOGS concentrator to 
supply the highest possible oxygen concentration. The maximum concentration light illuminates any time the lever is in 
the “MAX” position.  
Oxygen Pressure Lever — The pressure lever has three positions placarded, respectively, “EMERGENCY,” 
“NORMAL,” and “TEST MASK.” The “EMERG ENCY” position supplies the pilot with the positive pressure necessary 
during emergency situations such as cockpit smoke and fumes. When the lever is set to “NORMAL”, the regulator supplies a slight positive pressure  to the crewmember. The “TEST MASK” posi tion supplies highly pressurized flow to 
check the face- to-mask seal.  
OBOGS Annunciators  - OBOGS status is indicated by two annunciators on the annunciator panel in each cockpit . The 
first is the OBOGS FAIL light. This is a warning annunciator that will light when the low pressure switch is closed. This 
occurs whenever there is low bleed air pressure before the concentrator (less than 6.5 psi) and could illuminate prior to 
engine start or when a loss of bleed air occurs. The second is the OBOGS TEMP light. This is a caution annunciator that is activated by the temperature sensor just past the heat exchanger. The light will become illuminated if the temperature 
out of the heat exchanger goes above 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  
Regulator BIT Button  — The built in test (BIT) button activates the initiated OBOGS BIT (I -BIT) any time after engine 
start and the three minute warm -up. The I -BIT provides verification that the OBOGS sensor and “OBOGS FAIL” 
annunciator are operating properly. Momentarily pushing the BIT butt on opens a valve in the concentrator that allows 
ambient air into the concentration monitor. Once the oxygen concentration drops below normal (approximately 20 to 30 
seconds), the “OBOGS FAIL” light should illuminate. Once the valve closes and oxygen concentration in the monitor 
returns to normal, the “OBOGS FAIL” annunciator should extinguish within two minutes. If the annunciator fails to 
illuminate or extinguish as expected, either the annunciator or the monitor has failed.  
Oxygen Flow Indicator  — The flow indicator provides a visual indication of gaseo us flow through the regulator. As 
each inhalation takes place,  the flow indicator will show white , and upon exhalation, it will show black . Additionally, 
when performing an oxygen mask seal check, it will s how white if a leak is detected and show black if the seal is good.  
T-6A OBOGS  
For T -6A OBOGS (Figure 1 3-2), bleed air is tapped from a port on the left side of the T -6A engine. This bleed air is sent 
through an oxygen system shutoff  valve, an OBOGS heat e xchanger and  a high temperature which ensures it’s not too 
hot. Then it will pass through a drain valve to remove excess condensation before passing across a low pressure switch that ensures adequate air pressure and into the OBOGS unit in the fuselage rig ht side avionics bay. This unit extracts 
oxygen from the conditioned engine bleed air. A concentrator in the OBOGS unit automatically adjusts the oxygen 
concentration for the current altitude based on the current cockpit pressure. The oxygen then flows fro m the OBOGS unit 
to a plenum. This plenum functions as a holding tank between the OBOGS unit and the regulators. It is a small container 
located out -of-view below the concentrator.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 145 
 
Figure 1 3-2 — T-6 OBOGS Components  
In the event of OBOGS system failure, the plenum will provide a very limited supply of oxygen (approximately one 
breath) for the aircrew until the emergency oxygen system is activated. The duration of this supply depends on factors 
such as cockpit pressurization, aircraft pressure altitude, pi lot regulator settings, and pilot demand.  
Emergency Oxygen Systems  
 
Figure 1 3-3 — Emergency Oxygen System  
Emergency Oxygen Cylinder 
The emergency oxygen system (Figure 1 3-3) is a high -pressure gas, continuous flow oxygen system. I t provides 100% 
oxygen for the first two to four minutes. After that time, the anti -suffocation valve or CRU -60/P (if ship supply hose is 
disconnected) mixes an increasing amount of ambient air until the emergency bottle is depleted. Activate this emergenc y 
system when the normal aircraft oxygen system is interrupted due to failure, depletion, contamination, or egress at 
altitudes up to FL500. Figure 13 -3 depicts the emergency oxygen system components.  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 146 
The cylinder is installed on the left side of the eject ion seat. The emergency oxygen cylinder has a pressure ga uge to 
indicate the amount of oxygen available. The system supplies the crewmember with oxygen automatically during 
ejection. The system may be activated for use on board the aircraft if the OBOGS do es not function properly. 
Approximately 8 -10 minutes oxygen is available for emergency use.  
Ejection automatically starts the positive flow of oxygen to the crewmember. Emergency oxygen flow continues for 
approximately 8- 10 minutes or until seat/man separa tion. The emergency oxygen cylinder is sufficiently charged for 
flight if the contents ga uge pointer is anywhere within the black band.  
Emergency Oxygen Manual Control  
A green control loop (Figure 1 3-4) is located on the left side of each seat and forms part of the emergency oxygen 
operating lever. Should the OBOGS fail, the emergency oxygen suppl y may be activated by performing a rearward pull  
on the control  handle . The emergency oxygen cylinder will supply oxygen for approximately 8– 10 minutes.  
Note  — Once activated, ejection seat emergency oxygen cannot be shut off and will provide oxygen flow until the 
cylinder  is depleted (approximately 8 –10 minutes).

Helmet Assemblies and Oxygen Masks  
Protective Helmets  
Air Force aircrews use the HGU -55/P helmet. It is designed for use in high-
performance aircraft. The HGU -55/P helmet shown in Figure 1 3-5 is gray, low -
profile model made of lightweight material and with a detachable visor. The HGU- 55/P provides:  
Protection from head injury and ambient noise  
Mounting for the visor and oxygen mask  
Communications  
It is available in three sizes  — medium, large and, extra- large.  
New fighter aircraft require a lighter weight oxygen mask that does not slide down  the face during high -G maneuvering, provides lower bulk and better 
visibility (lower profile), and reduces pressure points or “hot spots” during normal flight (comfort).  
Advanced masks were designed to withstand positive pressure. The MBU -series 
masks are designed for pressure demand oxygen systems and hold internal 
pressures in excess of ambient or outside pressure.

Figure 1 3-6 — MBU -20/P Oxygen Mask  
MBU -20/P Oxygen Mask  
The MBU -20/P pressur e demand oxygen mask (Figure 1 3-6) has separate faceform and hardshell assemblies. The mask 
was designed to provide pressure breathing for G (PBG) capability to tactical aircrew, while reducing the probability of 
G-induced loss of co nsciousness. The mask offers a  low-profile for increased downward field of view, has l ower 
inhalation and exhalation resistance, and increases the range of fitting for aircrew members. The MBU -20A/P is a variant 
of the MBU -20/P for non -PBG applications. The MBU -20A/P comes in five sizes – X-small narrow, small narrow, 
medium narrow, medium wide, and large wide.  
The components of the mask include separate faceform and hardshell assembly, a low -resistance delivery tube (mask 
hose), mask connector, anti -stretch cord, microphone, communication cord, oxygen mask retention bayonets and separate 
inhalation/exhalation valves. The PBG bladder supply hose is removed for the MBU -20A/P variant.  
Oxygen Mask Visual Inspection  
1. Inspect oxygen hose for cuts, breaks, dust, and dirt.  
2. Inspect microphone assembly for damage, loose connection, and proper seating. Do not pull on microphone

Figure 1 3-7 — CRU- 60/P  
Connector Assembly, CRU- 60/P  
The CRU -60/P is an oxygen mask -to-regulator co nnector assembly (Figure 1 3-7). It is a three -way connector providing 
connection sites for the regulator hose, the mask connector, and the emergency oxygen cylinder hose. The CRU -60/P 
attaches to the parachute harness, at the intersection of the horizontal  chest strap, by securing a dovetail mounting plate 
into a receiving bracket on the harness.  
Regulator hose site  — is on the end of the two -inch flexible hose and is a simple push- pull connection. A silver C -ring 
provides 12 to 20 pounds of disconnect tens ion. This tension is enough to maintain the connection during normal flight 
operations but permits automatic disconnect during ejection or ground egress. The two -inch flexible hose permits a 180 
degree swing in any direction and contains an anti -stretch co rd to prevent over -stretching during disconnect. The 
connection site also incorporates a rubber gasket t o ensure an airtight seal and a disconnect warning valve to offer 
resistance of flow during inhalation if the inlet is not properly inserted into the aircraft oxygen regulator hose. This airflow 
restriction warns the aircrew of a disconnect from the aircraft oxygen system. The valve also relieves excess pressure 
from the continuous flow emergency oxygen cylinder . 
Mask connector site — is the hard portion of the connector assembly and contains a black O -ring in a recess to ensure 
another airtight seal. The oxygen mask hose connects to this site with a push -turn action. Normal disconnect from the 
regulator hose is at the mask connector site.  
Preflight Checks  
 
Figure 1 3-8 — PRICE Check  


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 149 
A preflight check of personal equipment and the aircraft oxygen system is mandatory. Before going to the aircraft, you 
are required to inspect your personal oxygen equipment and test it with the MQ -1 Tester in the life support section. This 
brief inspection ensures the proper operation of the mask and helmet, independent of the aircraft system. As part of the aircraft preflight, you are required to check the proper function of the oxygen system. Traditionally, all military aviators have resorted to a concise acronym to describe the steps of this preflight check . It is the “PRICE” (Figure 1 3-8) check 
with each letter in the acronym representing a discrete step in the preflight inspection of the aircraft oxygen system, mask,  
and re gulator.  
Note  — The T -6 OBOGS does not have a pressure requirement; therefore, this step in the PRICE check may be 
eliminated making it a RICE check for this aircraft.  
SCOT Communications and Oxygen System Tester  
The S COT  Tester allows testing the operatio nal capability of helmet, oxygen mask, and communications prior to leaving 
the life support section and proceeding to the aircraft. The tester allows leak testing at three pressure levels, simulating regulator pressures at 41M (41,000 ft) , 43M  (43,000 ft) , and 45M (45,000 ft) settings. A red light illuminates when a 
flow of five liters or greater occurs. Communications are tested by attaching the microphone and headset to a jack on the 
control panel, or by an audio cable attached to the control panel (the audio cable is configured for the active noise 
reduction system). To test communications, speak into the microphone and you should hear your voice in the headset. 
Continuity of communication components is performed by switching the audio select switch to th e CONT position. If 
the impedance of the earphone is correct, a green light will come on. A second green light will come on if the impedance 
of the microphone is correct. If either is shorted, its light will turn red.  
Use the following SCOT Tester prefligh t procedural checklist:  
1. Power switch ON  
2. Place the mask switch in the normal position  
3. Position place ALT SELECT switch in the 41M position  
4. Toggle the TEST switch to the HOLD position and wait until the READY green light comes on  
5. Don oxygen ma sk and breathe in deeply, then breathe normally 
MBU -20/P third locking position  
If breathing is difficult, the valve is defective…see life support  
6. Toggle the MASK switch to the ALTITUDE position  
7. Momentarily stop breathing, observe the LEAK light indi cator  
8. Repeat the previous step in the 43M and 45M altitude positions  
9. Place the ALT SELECT switch in the 45M position  
10. Exhale slowly, if excessive resistance to exhalation is evident, the valve is faulty. See Aircrew Flight Equipment . 
11. Reset all  switches to their original position, unit off.  
12. Connect oxyge n mask communications cord to SCOT  tester  
Check communications, should be able to hear yourself in the helmet  
Note  — If any aspect of the oxygen or communications checks is faulty, return the  helmet and mask to Aircrew Flight 
Equipment  personnel for corrective action. Then, repeat the checklist procedures.  
RICE Check  
The RICE check is not restricted to aircraft preflight, but should be used by the aircrew as a troubleshooting technique 
anytime  the oxygen system is suspect.  
R — Regulator.  
1. Check the general external condition and appearance of the regulator. Visually inspect the regulator for dents, cracks, 
and flow indicator lens . There should not be oil, grease, water, etc. on the regulator.  Inspect for proper lever movement 
(indicators/switches).  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 150 
2. Check the internal condition and function (integrity) of the regulator with the mask on and connected to the aircraft 
regulator hose. Use the following steps to perform the internal check:  
a. SUPPLY lever  — “ON”  
b. Concentration lever  — “MAX”  
c. Pressure lever  — “EMER”  
d. Breathe normally for a minimum of three cycles; monitor the flow indicator for alternate black and white 
indications.  
e. Hold breath. If the flow indicator remains black, system integrity is confirmed. If white, then a leak is indicated. 
Check mask, connections, regulator configuration, and then aircraft system in that order.  
f. Concentration lever to “NORMAL.” The flow indicator should remain black. White indicates a leak.  
Note  — It’s possible to cause a leak indication with excessive head movement. To receive an accurate indication, hold 
your head still and look straight into the flow indicator. If a leak is suspected, locate the cause, correct and repeat steps  a 
through f.  
Warni ng — Correct all oxygen leaks prior to flight.  
I — Indicator. With the Concentration lever in the “MAX OXYGEN” position, check the flow indicator for proper 
operation. Once proper operation is verified, return the Concentration lever to the “NORMAL” positi on. The indicator 
can also be used to monitor your rate of breathing if you suspect hypoxia or hyperventilation.  
C — Connections. Check the regulator hose for wear, tear, and deterioration. Check the regulator hose site of the 
connector assembly for the pr esence of the silver C -ring and rubber washer. A 12 to 20 pound pull is required to separate 
the regulator hose from the connector. Confirm proper connections of the oxygen mask hose and the regulator hose. 
Check the three communications cord connection si tes. 
E — Emergency. Ensure the emergency oxygen cylinder hose is properly connected to the connector assembly and in 
good condition. Check the pressure gage for a reading of 1,800 psi . 
Mask and Helmet Care  
Do 
1. Have the aircrew flight equipment section in spect the mask at least every 30 days.  
2. Inspect and test mask for operation before leav ing the life support section (SCOT  Tester).  
3. Clean the mask at the end of each flying day. Use cleaning solution and gauze to wipe interior and to remove 
perspiratio n, facial oils, and foreign matter.  
4. Check helmet prior to each flight for overall condition. Check security of chin and nape straps, visor lens for cracks 
and scratches, cleanliness and visor operation, and communication connectors.  
5. Check mask and he lmet daily for wear and tear. Have items replaced as necessary.  
6. Check bayonet connectors and ensure that locking pins operate freely.  
7. Whenever possible, transport the helmet assembly in a helmet bag. When unable to carry the assembly in a helmet 
bag, carry the helmet and mask by the chinstrap like a bucket.  
8. Have the life support section inspect your helmet any time it is dropped or cracked.  
Don’t  
1. Don’t paint the helmet. Mark only as directed and then IAW the applicable technical orders.  
2. Don’t  carry the helmet by the communications cord or mask.  
3. Don’t allow the helmet to strike objects that would damage the protective surface.  
4. Don’t disassemble the mask. This operation requires special tools and should only be done by qualified life support 
personnel.  
5. Don’t modify or alter the mask.  

UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 151 
6. Don’t store the helmet/mask in direct sunlight or near heat for extended periods or in the aircraft when off station.  
7. Don’t puncture the mask.  
8. Don’t use pencils, pens, or sharp objects to loosen val ves. 
9. Don’t loan equipment. It was fitted for you.  
Remember , this aircrew flight equipment is yours. Routine professional care and maintenance ensures trouble- free 
operation. Direct any questions or concerns regarding this equipment to the aircrew flight  equipment technicians.  
Summary  
Oxygen storage and delivery systems, combined with your personal oxygen equipment, provide you the supplemental 
oxygen you need because of the atmospheric changes that occur with altitude. Air Force publications require the use of 
supplemental oxygen during high altitude flights. While there are several types of oxygen storage and delivery systems, 
the T -6 uses OBOGS as the primary source of oxygen and the high pressure bottle in the ejection seat as the emergency 
source. OBO GS provides oxygen throughout the flight regime and is capable of providing up to 95 percent oxygen. The 
most critical component of the effectiveness of this system is your knowledge of the capabilities of the OBOGS system 
and how to care for and use your personal equipment.

High Pressure Emergency  Oxygen Demonstration  
1. Demonstrate proper p ressure breathing  techniques  
2. Demonstrate the ability to speak over comm while pressure breathing  
You w ill receive training on the high p ressure emergency oxygen system . Positive pressure breathing requires th at you 
monitor your rate and depth of breathing. Remember, passive inhalation and active (forceful) exhalation, with a pause 
between, will help prevent hyper ventilation. Your lecturer  will have you activate the high pressure system . The lecturer  
may ask fo r a communications check during this time; break your words up into syllables and forcefully speak against 
the pressure. The combined effects of pressure breathing and gas expansion at altitude may make it very difficult to perform flight tasks proficientl y. This training simulates activating the aircraft emergency oxygen system which would 
be initiated by pulling the green ring in the T -6.

Introduction 
The Initial Chamber F light provides practical experience in, and demonstrates the effects of, barometric pressure change. 
Figure 15- 1 provides the Initial Chamber Flight profile. Remember, the altitude chamber is an extension of the classroom 
and the chamber flight is intended to enhance your learning experience. A rapid decompression chamber flight (Figure 
15-2) is part of the chamber experience as well . 
 
Figure 15-1 — Initial Chamber  Flight Profile  
Information  
Preflight Briefing  
A preflight briefing is conducted to ensure safe and efficient operation and completion of the chamber flight. You will be briefed on the flight profile, pu rpose and procedure. You will m ay out a questionnaire in order  to determine your 
immediate physical status (colds, headache, abdominal pain, medication, etc. ) before the chamber flight. If you have any 


UNCLASSIFIED 
UNCLASSIFIED 159 
medical concerns please notify the instructor. At the conclusion of the preflight bri efing, you will be given an altitude 
chamber seat number and directed to the chamber. The main pur pose of the chamber flight is to validate student 
proficiency with  performan ce based objectives designed around hazards  encounter ed during flight.  
Chamber Fli ght for T -6 Pilots  
Enter the altitude chamber and sit in your preassigned seat. The chamber crew personnel will assist you in performing a 
PRICE check to guarantee the integrity of your oxygen equipment. Denitrogenation time (30 minutes) begins after all students and inside observers have completed a PRICE check and are breathing 100 percent oxygen. A communications 
check is conducted after all students and crew personnel are in position. An ear and sinus check is conducted to identify any potential difficu lties. The Valsalva maneuver is necessary only on descent. After the ear and sinus check is completed, 
the remainder of the denitrogenation time is used to review the PRICE check and practice pressure breathing.  
At FL250, a hypoxia demonstration is conduct ed to  allow you to experience your sign s and symptom s of hypoxia. Once 
all students have experience d hypoxia symptoms and recover, you will begin your descent to FL180. Students will 
remove their masks once again at FL220 to experience the effects of mild hypoxia on vision.  
Equalizing the pressure in the middle ears and sinuses is your main concern during the final descent to ground level. The remaining demonstration of the chamber flight is with the emergency oxygen cylinder. Remember your pressure 
breathi ng technique as you use the emergenc y oxygen cylinder.  Once ground level is reached, do not disconnect from 
the regulator hose or the communication cord until instructed to do so.  
Rapid Decompression  
As part of your altitude chamber experience, you are ass igned to a group (with one Inside Observer (IO)) for the rapid 
decompression chamber flight. Enter the lock portion of the altitude chamber and follow the instructions of your IO. A 
preflight check of your oxygen equipment and an intercom check are conduct ed after your group and the IO are in 
position. The door is closed and you will be briefed on the phenomena of a rapid decompression. After the briefing is 
complete, a rapid decompression will occur without prior notice.  Figure 15 -2 provides an example of  a rapid 
decompression flight profile. The decompression causes an ascent from ground level to about 10,000 feet in 
approximately two seconds. The final altitude will be determined by the field elevation, but will be around 10,000 feet. 
Your responsibilitie s are to not  hold your breath, gangload your regulator and check your connections.  
Final descent begins after everyone recovers, a communications check is completed, and the emergency lever is returned 
to NORMAL. Equalizing the pressure in the middle ears and the sinuses is your main co ncern during descent. Your inside  
observer will discuss the physiological effects and physical characteristics of a rapid decompression, pointing out their 
significance to an actual event on an aircraft. Once ground level is reached, do not disconnect from the regulator hose or 
the communication cord until instructed by the IO.

Post Flight Briefing  
The postflight briefing reviews the chamber flight and emphasizes the learning outcomes. You are given instructions to 
follow in the event of a delayed reaction and restriction s you must adhere to following the chamber flight.  
Because nitrogen in body tissue comes out of solution during exposure to low barometric pressure, you are restricted from strenuous activity for 12 hours following the chamber flight. These precautions hel p prevent postflight DCS.  
There is also the possibility of experiencing a postflight ear block (delayed reaction) after breathing 100 percent oxygen 
for an extended period of time. As the 100 percent oxygen
 diffuses out of the middle ear space into the sur rounding 
tissues, a relative low pressure area results. The low pressure area allows the now greater ambient pressure on the exterior 
surface of the ear drum to deflect the ear drum inward, dulling the hearing and producing pain. So, continue to perform 
the Valsalva maneuver as necessary following the chamber flight.

AP118  — Spatial Disorientation Experience  
Hours and Medium  
0.5 Hours (IBT)  
Objective  
Recognize the effects of three types of spatial disorientation while performing basic flight maneuvers inside the spatial 
disorientation trainer.  
Introduction 
Instinctively , people  rely primarily on their visual/audible (sight & sound), vestibular (position and motion detection), 
and proprioceptor (“seat -of-the-pants”) perceptions for their sense of direction and physical orientation cues . Quite 
naturally, during daytime fli ghts, many aircraft pilots tend to rely heavily on visual cues from the horizon to maintain 
good spatial orientation. However, these instinctive sensory methods can easily fail to detect real changes in altitude, 
attitude, or motion, and can even synthesiz e false cues for each. In addition, it has been proven that the semi -circular 
canals of the human ear are not very effective or reliable when serving as “change -in-velocity” sensors.  
Information  
Spatial Disorientation Trainer  
The Spatial Disorientation Tra iner (Figure 18 -1) is an interactive, multifunctioning training system with built -in 
flexibility to accommodate the training needs of all flight students from first -time trainees to experienced pilots. It consists 
of a single occupant cockp it assembly moun t on a sophisticated motion base, and simulates a T -6A Texan Flight Training 
Aircraft. The cockpit includes a pilot seat, closed -loop interactive flight controls, forward out -the-window visual display, 
front panel instrumentation gauges , and real aircraft sounds .  
The Spatial Disorientation Trainer offers an economical approach  to simulating physiological disorientation effects and 
can be used in flight navigation training and refresher situations by allowing a series of realistic virtual problem scenario s 
to be experienced without placing the pilot’s life in any danger.  
Note  – Training device lesson hours are per student. Training time must compensate for training device capacity and size 
of training class.
