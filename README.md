## Data Structure

### Flashcard Format
Each card includes:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `category` - Topic area
- `difficulty` - critical, high, or medium
- `type` - boldface or limit
- `question` - What you need to know
- `answer` - Full detailed answer
- `shortAnswer` - Condensed version for quiz matching

### Progress Tracking
The app stores three types of data in localStorage:
- `t6a-study-stats` - Overall statistics (correct, incorrect, streaks)
- `t6a-missed-cards` - Array of card IDs that need review
- `t6a-card-stats` - Spaced repetition data for each card (interval, ease factor, next review date)

## Customization

### Adding New Cards
Edit `app/page.js` and add to the `flashcardsData` array:

```javascript
{
  id: 71,
  category: "Your Category",
  difficulty: "high",
  type: "boldface",
  question: "Your question here?",
  answer: "Full detailed answer",
  shortAnswer: "SHORT VERSION"
}
```

### Modifying Spaced Repetition
The SM-2 algorithm parameters can be adjusted in the `calculateNextReview` function in `app/page.js`:
- Initial ease factor: 2.5
- Minimum ease factor: 1.3
- Interval progression: 1 day ‚Üí 6 days ‚Üí interval √ó easeFactor

### Styling
Colors and themes can be modified in the component using Tailwind classes. Main color scheme:
- Primary: Blue (`bg-blue-600`)
- Success: Green (`bg-green-600`)
- Error: Red (`bg-red-600`)
- Warning: Yellow (`bg-yellow-600`)
- Background: Slate (`bg-slate-900`)
