      question: "What is the maximum torque limit for takeoff in the T-6A?",
      options: ["90%", "95%", "100%", "105%"],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "Maximum takeoff torque is 100%. This limit protects the engine and propeller from excessive stress during the high-power phase of flight. While transient torque spikes of 101-107% are allowed for only 5 seconds (such as during rapid power changes), sustained operation at 100% is the maximum for takeoff to ensure engine longevity and safety.",

      options: ["120 KIAS", "150 KIAS", "180 KIAS", "200 KIAS"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Maximum speed with landing gear and/or flaps extended is 150 KIAS (VLE/VFE). This limitation exists because the gear and flaps create significant aerodynamic drag and structural loading at higher speeds. Exceeding this speed could cause structural damage to the gear doors, flap actuators, or the extended surfaces themselves. Always ensure airspeed is below 150 KIAS before extending gear or flaps.",

      options: ["-2.0 to +5.0", "-3.5 to +7.0", "-4.0 to +8.0", "0 to +6.0"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Clean configuration symmetric G limits are -3.5 to +7.0 Gs. These limits protect the airframe from structural damage during maneuvering. The positive G limit (+7.0) is higher because the aircraft structure is designed to withstand greater upward forces (pulling back on the stick). The negative G limit (-3.5) is lower because pushing forward creates unusual structural loads. Remember: with stores or flaps extended, these limits are reduced to protect the additional equipment.",

      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "Normal recovery fuel is 200 pounds. This provides adequate fuel for the traffic pattern, approach, and a go-around if needed. The fuel hierarchy is: Normal Recovery = 200 lbs, Minimum Fuel = 150 lbs dual (200 lbs solo), Emergency Fuel = 100 lbs. Declaring minimum fuel alerts ATC to prioritize your landing, while emergency fuel requires immediate landing at the nearest suitable field. Always plan to land with at least normal recovery fuel for safety margins.",

      options: ["15 knots", "20 knots", "25 knots", "30 knots"],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "Maximum crosswind on dry runway is 25 knots. As runway conditions degrade, the crosswind limit decreases significantly: Wet runway = 10 knots, Icy runway = 5 knots. This is because reduced friction makes it harder to maintain directional control during takeoff and landing. The weathervaning tendency (nose wanting to turn into the wind) becomes increasingly difficult to counteract with rudder as the runway becomes slicker. Always check runway conditions and current winds before flight.",

      options: ["10 seconds", "20 seconds", "30 seconds", "60 seconds"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Maximum torque starter limit is 20 seconds. Exceeding this can overheat and damage the starter motor. After each start/motoring attempt, wait 30 seconds before the next attempt, then 2 minutes, then 5 minutes, then 30 minutes. These cooling periods prevent starter burnout.",

      options: ["Above 100%", "Above 105%", "Above 107%", "Above 110%"],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "Torque above 107% is indicative of a system malfunction. While transient torque from 101-107% is allowed for 5 seconds, anything above 107% suggests PMU failure or other critical issues. This requires immediate attention and likely engine shutdown.",

      options: ["750°C", "820°C", "870°C", "871°C"],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation:
        "Do not attempt restart if ITT exceeds 871°C. This temperature indicates severe engine damage from a hot start. Attempting to restart could cause catastrophic turbine failure. At 871-1000°C, you have only 5 seconds before permanent damage occurs.",

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Transient ITT limit is 821-870°C for 20 seconds. This allows brief temperature excursions during rapid power changes or hot day operations. Continuous operation at these temperatures will damage turbine blades.",

      options: ["60%", "61%", "67%", "70%"],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "Minimum N1 for ground pressurization is 67%. Below this, the ECS (Environmental Control System) cannot provide adequate cabin pressurization or cooling. In flight, minimum N1 for pressurization is also 67%. This is a gas generator speed requirement for the bleed air system to function properly.",

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Normal cabin pressurization above 18,000 ft MSL is 3.6 ± 0.2 PSI. This maintains cabin altitude around 8,000-10,000 feet for crew comfort and reduces hypoxia risk. The overpressurization safety valve opens at 4.0 PSI to prevent structural damage.",

      options: ["100 pounds", "150 pounds", "200 pounds", "250 pounds"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Minimum fuel for aerobatics is 150 pounds per side (300 pounds total). This ensures adequate fuel pressure during negative G maneuvers and prevents fuel starvation. Unporting (fuel pump losing suction) during aerobatics with low fuel can cause engine failure.",

      options: ["10 knots", "15 knots", "20 knots", "25 knots"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Maximum crosswind for formation takeoff/landing is 15 knots. Formation operations require tighter limits because you must maintain position while compensating for crosswind. The standard crosswind limit (25 knots dry) is reduced to 15 knots for formation work.",

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Maximum tailwind for takeoff is 10 knots. Tailwinds increase takeoff distance and reduce climb performance. While landing with a tailwind is sometimes necessary, takeoff should be delayed or use another runway if tailwind exceeds 10 knots.",

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "Spins above 22,000 feet pressure altitude are prohibited. At higher altitudes, reduced air density makes spin recovery more difficult and unpredictable. Additionally, OBOGS performance degrades and hypoxia risk increases during the high workload of spin recovery.",

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Aerobatics/spins oil pressure is 40-130 PSI (wider than normal 90-120 PSI). During aerobatic maneuvers, oil sloshes around causing pressure fluctuations. The wider range accounts for these variations while maintaining adequate lubrication.",
