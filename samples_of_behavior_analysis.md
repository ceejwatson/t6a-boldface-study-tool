## NOTES

1. Some Samples of Behavior from AP109 and AP113 are practical demonstrations and may not require traditional multiple-choice questions.

2. The current 62 questions provide good foundational coverage but miss significant gaps in critical areas like hypocapnia treatment, trapped gas disorders, complete DCS treatment, and AGSM errors.

3. The weakest coverage is in AP105 (Vision) at 33%, AP108 (Spatial Disorientation) at 35%, and AP113 (Oxygen Equipment) at 27%.

4. The strongest coverage is in AP102 (Respiration and Circulation) at 71% and AP104 (Cabin Pressurization) at 60%.

5. Priority should be given to safety-critical content that directly relates to emergency procedures and BOLDFACE items.
